<p><span class="dm-dp-initialText">I used to laugh</span> quietly to myself when <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a> clients came to us, asking to license our design system product. “We’re a services company,” we’d politely reply. “We don’t have a design system product to license to you.”</p>
<p>Inevitably, the next question would be, “Do you have a product you would recommend to us?”</p>
<p>When we dug further, many of those requests seemed to be specifically around <i><a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/glossary/#token">design tokens</a></i>, a concept pioneered by design systems evangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/jina/">Jina Anne</a> during her time at Salesforce, working on the <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/">Lightning Design System</a>. Of course, clients wouldn’t be asking for design tokens by name; they’d instead be looking for solutions that helped them “scale their brand,” “create a source of truth,” and other aspirations like that.</p>
<p>As much as we had—and have—great relationships with many friends building tools for the design system space, none of them really seemed to accomplish (or accomplish well) what these clients were asking for. So, like many services companies that see the same unsolved problem over and over again, we figured we might as well be the ones to try and solve it.</p>
<p>I built an embarrasingly simple proof-of-concept. I showed it to my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieSCamacho/">Leslie Camacho</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mikecarbone/">Mike Carbone</a>, and we decided to officially start <a href="https://usearcade.com/">Arcade</a> together in June 2020. For the last 10 months, we’ve been quietly building Arcade and using it on our own products—this site is actually <a href="https://api.usearcade.com/api/public/projects/603aa3d6806c0f0017cb65a5/exports/css/live">powered by Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve launched <a href="https://usearcade.com/">a brand new site</a> and are ready to open up Arcade to a small number of teams to kick the tires and see how well a tool like Arcade serves their needs. The early access fee is $2500, and we’re looking specifically for teams that already understand and use design tokens, are open to our opinions on how to better manage brand decisions, and have a well-rounded, cross-disciplinary team of at least one designer, one engineer, and one product manager.</p>
<p>Does that sound like your team? Is Arcade the kind of solution you’ve been looking for? Head over to <a href="https://usearcade.com/">usearcade.com</a> and apply for early access!</p>

<p>As we at <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a> work with newer and/or more junior SuperFriends, I’m recognizing the need for different ways to support how people learn and grow. Learning comes in many different forms, and <em>I’m</em> learning that people need help with a lot of them. Learning can’t just be something a professional does in their own time <em>outside</em> of work; it has to be an integral part of the work itself.</p>
<p>Here are some specific <em>support systems</em> we’re trying to invest in more:</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-transfer">Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<h3 id="definition-knowledge-transfer">Definition</h3>
<p>This is probably the most common form—more commonly known as “teaching”—that most think of when they think of “learning.” Knowledge transfer is the idea that someone possesses information that you don’t, and you get that information by them bestowing it to you. The education system is primarily built on this type of learning, where experienced teachers bestow their knowledge upon eager students.</p>
<h3 id="how-knowledge-transfer-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>In order to do good work, SuperFriends need information about the client, which happens early in projects mostly through sales and onboarding conversations. So, they’re being “taught” the information they need to do the work they’re hired for.</p>
<p>We also hold monthly Snack ’n’ Learns—a cross-time-zone version of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/lunch-and-learn">Lunch and Learns</a>—open to all SuperFriends across a variety of topics, some directly applicable to SuperFriendly projects like a panel about demos of things we’re all working on and others much more broad like an overview of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-knowledge-transfer">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C- (average).</strong> We currently don’t do much yet to help SuperFriends patch skill gaps through knowledge transfer. One of the biggest criticisms of our <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">apprenticeship</a> from former apprentices is that it focused too heavily on developing <a href="https://www.leadersedge.com/brokerage-ops/the-new-power-skills">power skills</a> and professionalism more than it did skills of craft. If someone isn’t strong enough at a skill like, say, <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> design or data analysis, all we do now is assess that they’re underqualified, suggest they try to get better, and don’t match them to a project yet. We’ve started to try and correct that in small ways by doing things like purchasing online courses and conference/workshop tickets for SuperFriends.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-knowledge-transfer">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We’ve been creating a few libraries that SuperFriends can access at any time. Purchasing an online course should mean that all SuperFriends can utilize it (provided that the license allows for that). We’ve also started the process of collecting the Snack ’n’ Learn sessions into a curriculum that will eventually becoming a “SuperFriendly Fundamentals Library” that we can use to onboard new SuperFriends.</li>
	<li>We’ve started conversations with people who we can hire to act as consultants for the team of SuperFriends. They wouldn’t be on the team itself or be client-facing; their roles would be purely to support filling in knowledge gaps that SuperFriends need to do their work.</li>
	<li>For the last year, we’ve been trying a pairing system for every discipline on a project (design, engineering, producing, etc.) That’s working well in theory, but we still have a lot of kinks to work out in how to allow ample room for this style of work, as well as what kinds of expectations to have about each person in the pair. We’re continuing to tweak this dynamic from project to project and pair to pair to see what feels most useful, and I’m very hopeful that this will be extremely fruitful very soon for all involved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="knowledge-seeking">Knowledge Seeking</h2>
<h3 id="definition-knowledge-seeking">Definition</h3>
<p>Knowledge seeking is the typical <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> of the self-starter. Self-starters are generally good at finding their own solutions, as opposed to having those solutions given to them or mandated. That means a lot of reading, watching videos, exploring, and generally an insatiable curiosity as compared to the expectation of being taught by someone else. One of my hypotheses in starting the apprenticeship was that it’s not ironic to <em>teach</em> someone how to be a self-starter as opposed to it being a character or personality trait. I evaluated that by looking at how much the capacity for knowledge seeking—and confidence in it—changed over time.</p>
<h3 id="how-knowledge-seeking-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>For better or worse—probably worse—our industry is drawn to people who do their own knowledge seeking as a matter of habit. Those who have a lot of experience with knowledge seeking tend to be more self-sufficient than others. We don’t really “support” knowledge seeking as much as we try to continually encourage it.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-knowledge-seeking">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>D (below average).</strong> I don’t know if it’s counterintuitive to try and <em>support</em> knowledge seeking, but I <em>do</em> know that we don’t explicitly encourage it or show SuperFriends exactly how there’s space for it on projects. It always seems to feel like something extra. That’s not great.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-knowledge-seeking">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reward knowledge seeking as part of the work. I’m not quite sure what good rewards are for this. Financial incentive? Public and private praise? Something else?</li>
	<li>Explicitly <em>discourage</em> the idea that knowledge seeking should only happen outside of work time.</li>
	<li>Build time and space into project plans specifically for knowledge seeking.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<h3 id="definition-purpose">Definition</h3>
<p>As Daniel Pink articulates in his book <cite><a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/">Drive</a></cite>, “autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels, but those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more.”</p>
<h3 id="how-purpose-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>One of our interview questions for both new and seasoned SuperFriends at the beginning of each project is, “What do you want and need out of your work right now in the season of life you’re in?” Historically, the answers have ranged from:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Money</li>
	<li>Distraction</li>
	<li>Some sort of impact in the world</li>
	<li>Opportunity to work on a specific kind of project or with a specific kind of client</li>
	<li>Learn a new skill</li>
	<li>Chance to hone a current skill</li>
	<li>Learn directly from a person with specific experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Our job on the SuperFriendly side and the Directors and Producers on the account becomes to help prioritize these outcomes for each individual SuperFriends.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-purpose">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>B+ (above average).</strong> We regularly have new SuperFriends that say things like, “Wow, no one’s ever asked me what my personal goals are for a project.”</p>
<p>We also start every new project with a “Superpowers Session,” where, in front of the whole team, a Producer reads out why each person was chosen for this work, what they bring to it, and also what they want to get out of it. This is the first step in making everyone on the team accountable for each of their teammates’ stated goals.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-purpose">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Make SuperFriends’ goals more present <em>throughout</em> a project, not just in the beginning. Projects start with a lot of momentum around personal goals, but that tends to wane as a project gets going and everyone is in the weeds.</li>
	<li>Normalize the idea that projects are about everyone’s professional <em>and</em> personal goals being met, not just our clients’ briefs. One thing I’ve been trying to say and signal lately is, “SuperFriendly is about SuperFriends, not clients.” Just yesterday, I had a conversation with a long-time SuperFriend who said to me, “I love the idea that we participate in a way we <em>want</em> to, but I don’t think that conversation can always be completely decoupled from how things might functionally get done.” It made me realize there’s still a lot of work to be done to get SuperFriends to accept the idea that projects aren’t just things where clients pay us to do whatever they want as a dry transaction. Instead, like grad school, I think of projects as great vehicles to explore professional and interpersonal theses, and clients get the tremendous benefit of the effects of that exploration.</li>
	<li>One idea of we’ve been talking about for a long time but haven’t yet implemented is to encourage SuperFriends to create their own “<a href="https://www.manualof.me/">user manuals</a>” to guide others on how to best work with them. I imagine that these manuals would contain some semblance of how a SuperFriend would want to grow and <em>why</em> they do what they do, and that would be integral to how people can relate to and interact with them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="stories-examples">Stories &amp; Examples</h2>
<h3 id="definition-examples">Definition</h3>
<p>Rather than talking about a concept abstractly, one way to help people learn is to tell and/or show them how it’s happened before in an applied way. Sharing stories and examples can go a long way toward making vague ideas concrete.</p>
<h3 id="how-examples-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Not a lot. One of the biggest strengths of <a href="https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/04/18/hollywood-model-work/">the Hollywood model</a> is also its weakness: solitude. SuperFriends working on a project don’t know how a previous project went, because they weren’t there. That means stories have to be <em>actively</em> shared, because they’re almost impossible to passively stumble upon.</p>
<p>We have dedicated <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channels for our most common disciplines: Directors, Producers, designers, and developers. Each has its own level of activity.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Our Producers channel is <em>incredibly</em> active. On the third Wednesday of every month, a different Producer will host an asychronous roundtable. They post a series of questions and prompts around a given topic, and as other Producers have time throughout the day, they’ll post their responses in threads for others to read and catch up on as they have a chance. Topics have ranged from onboarding techniques to meeting etiquette to flexibility, and lots more. Inevitably, those threads contain Producers saying different versions of, ”Here’s how I’ve dealt with or experienced that on my projects.”</li>
	<li>Our Directors channel is a ghost town (and I say that without judgment). We had a monthly roundtable Zoom call, but fewer and fewer showed up each month, I think as a combination of little incentive, busy schedules, and not knowing what to talk about.</li>
	<li>Our designers and developers channels have a steady buzz going, but they’re mostly functional. Lots of link sharing and debugging conversation, less story sharing.</li>
	<li>We’ve had two Snack ’n’ Learns that specifically share stories and examples. Our head of operations <a href="https://twitter.com/crystalvitelli">Crystal Vitelli</a> presented to our SuperFriends on “Things that Didn’t Go Well,” where she shared a few projects that went south and all the factors that led to that from contractual ambiguity to unstated expectations and lots more. We also had a panel discussion to talk about how Directors and Producers work together and how different that dynamic is from project to project, with lots of examples as proof points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assessment-examples">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>F (failing).</strong> We do a really poor job of sharing our stories both internally and externally. <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/helped/">Case studies</a> are an attempt, but they’re too time-consuming and difficult to create regularly and honestly trend more towards marketing pieces for prospective clients than helpful guides for SuperFriends.</p>
<p>We don’t as of yet have many good places for interproject and interdisciplinary sharing, and that constantly ails and irks me.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-examples">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More Snack ’n’ Learns that scrutinize past projects for the good, the bad, and the ugly</li>
	<li>I’ve been entertaining the thought for a while that I could just randomly record short <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Looms</a> every now and again of me talking through past projects to post to teams on Slack. Over time, we could build up a collection of these that SuperFriends could watch when they need to. I think the only thing stopping me from doing this is that I haven’t spent time to think about a good format for these and I’m scared of rambling and being incoherent in them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2>
<h3 id="definition-modeling">Definition</h3>
<p>People often think of mentorship as general guidance, but it’s actually a specific kind of guidance. In <cite>The Odyssey</cite>, Mentor was the person that Odysseus placed in charge of his whole estate—including guidance of his son Telemachus—while Odysseus went off to fight in the Trojan War. Mentor himself actually did a very poor job of all of that, but the goddess of wisdom Athena often transformed into Mentor to work with Telemachus to great success.</p>
<p>In <cite><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/the-odyssey-mentorship/542676/">The Odyssey’s Millennia-Old Model of Mentorship</a></cite>, Harvard classics professor Gregory Nagy points out that Athena’s intention as Mentor was to instill <i lang="el">menos</i> into Telemachus, which <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/element/menos">translates into something like</a> “mind, strength, courage, and force.” So, like Athena did through the guise of Mentor, <strong>mentorship is the act of giving someone else mental, heroic strength from the foundation of wisdom</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-modeling-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>If there’s one thing SuperFriends do, it’s talk. Especially as a company that started <a href="https://toni.org/2010/03/08/5-reasons-why-your-company-should-be-distributed/">distributed</a> in 2012, meetings abound, and delivering mental strength is a core ingredient of those meetings, both internally with SuperFriends only as well as externally with clients.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-modeling">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>A- (excellent).</strong> Mentorship was built into the foundation of SuperFriendly from the beginning, and it persists almost a decade later at a larger scale.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-modeling">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>Counterintuitively, we can do a better job overall by focusing <em>less</em> on mentorship. One thing that’s become abundantly clear is that mentorship alone isn’t enough. We can leave mentorship where it is and dial up some of the other things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>
<h3 id="definition-coaching">Definition</h3>
<p>In <cite><a href="https://www.coachingperformance.com/">Coaching for Performance</a></cite>, author Sir John Whitmore says <strong>coaching is unlocking people’s potential to maximize their own performance.</strong> I like that definition a lot, and I love that he takes the idea even further. He says, “Coaching is much bigger than coaching. It is a way of being that the whole world needs to get to, where the core theme is compassion for all people.”</p>
<h3 id="how-coaching-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>We have a principle that “everyone at SuperFriendly gets a coach.” If you’re a junior designer, you get paired with a more senior designer. Same for developers. Directors and Producers coach everyone on their team. Directors do 1-on-1s with me, and Producers do 1-on-1s with Crystal. Crystal and I have <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdary">Jen Dary</a> as a coach, and Jen and her team at <a href="https://www.beplucky.com/">Plucky</a> also coach 2 different SuperFriends every quarter.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-coaching">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>A- (excellent).</strong> I think our coaching philosophy program is strong.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-coaching">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>More rigor and regularity for more SuperFriends.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
<h3 id="definition-modeling">Definition</h3>
<p>Modeling is about intentionally providing behavior for others to observe and imitate.</p>
<h3 id="how-modeling-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Currently, modeling doesn’t happen as much as we need it to. There’s more mentorship happening than modeling, which has led to a culture of, “Do as I say, not as I do.”</p>
<p>This is also another area where SuperFriendly’s business model works against us. Even our most seasoned SuperFriends don’t always understand well enough what makes a SuperFriendly project different than other kinds of projects because their insight into a volume of SuperFriendly projects is limited. That makes it more difficult for modeling to happen if SuperFriends are unsure which behaviors to model for others. This is one of my biggest responsibilities and failure as SuperFriendly’s <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-modeling">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>F (failing).</strong> In addition to providing <a href="#stories-examples">Stories &amp; Examples</a>, modeling is our biggest gap area.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-modeling">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Our friends at <a href="https://www.seerinteractive.com/">Seer Interactive</a> were kind enough to walk us through their Universal Role Expectations documents for their employees. Among the many excellent things in those documents, my absolute favorite was the column labeled “Sights/Sounds,” which makes clear what an role expectation actually looks and sounds like in real life. For example, an expectation on thought leadership said, “Uses email, chat, and team meetings to ask and answer industry questions and participates in conversations.” The Sights/Sounds column for that expectation says, “I learned how to create this custom report to show me X, and you might also want to use this report and generate others like it. I can show you how.” I love how specific and actionable that is. There’s definitely a version of this in SuperFriendly’s very near future.</li>
	<li>One of my most recent conundrums is that <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/">I no longer work on any SuperFriendly projects myself</a>, but I’m one of the most likely candidates to provide useful modeling for our SuperFriends. How can I model good SuperFriend behavior without actually working on projects? I’m stumped about this one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="direction">Direction</h2>
<h3 id="definition-direction">Definition</h3>
<p>Directing someone is aiming them; it’s giving them a direction, a specific path to tread. A major part of direction is specifically telling someone what to do, and, by virtue of that, signaling to them what <em>not</em> to do and what they can ignore.</p>
<h3 id="how-direction-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Following the Hollywood model, every SuperFriendly project has a Director as a key role on the project. The Director’s job is to set and reinforce a vision for the project and make sure each SuperFriend knows how the part they play contributes to the overall vision.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-direction">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C (average).</strong> We provide the space for direction on every project by having a reserved spot for a Director, but providing direction is a tricky dynamic on a SuperFriendly project. Directing is hard, because it’s not <em>just</em> telling someone what to do; getting them to do it is the other half. Because most SuperFriends are independent freelancers, the idea of any kind of manager or boss or someeone telling them what to do that’s not a client is different than it looks at a full-time job. Because of a combination of factors, it’s all too easy for Directors to default more to <a href="#mentorship">mentoring</a> or <a href="#coaching">coaching</a> than directing.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-direction">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>We can definitely provide better role definition for Directors. It’s an ambiguous job, and part of the job is to actually manage ambiguity, but we’re starting to develop a rubric for different ways Directors can operate. Over the next few weeks and months, SuperFriendly will be documenting and delivering more of this clarity for our Directors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="accountability-partners">Accountability Partners</h2>
<h3 id="definition-accountability-partners">Definition</h3>
<p>Accountability comes from defining standards, having a way to measure whether that standard is being met, and implementing positive and/or negative consequences based on whether the standards are met. (I’ve previously written <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/accountability/">more about accountability before</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> (which stands for “National Novel Writing Month”) is one of my favorite examples of accountability. The challenge is to write 50,000 words of a novel within the 30 days of November. That’s a daunting enough task for any aspiring novelist, but the simple fact that you know others are doing it with you is extremely motivating for just under 1 million writers that have participated. The positive and negative consequences are simple but effective: once you sign up, you feel embarrassed if you can’t make the commitment you agreed to and you feel amazing if you can.</p>
<h3 id="how-accountability-partners-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>We don’t have anything intentional set up to encourage an accountability partner program, but a few instances of it have cropped up organically. In our apprenticeship program, multiple apprentices at the same skill level within the same cohort have used each other for motivation. And some SuperFriends have taken advantage of our community to proactively reach out to others at the same skill level on other projects for camaraderie and support.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-accountability-partners">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C (average).</strong> That fact that we haven’t set anything up specifically for this but it’s happening anyway is a promising sign.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-accountability-partners">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Set up an accountability program! That might look like pairing folks together for a period of time with the explicit charge of holding each other accountable, and supporting them in that effort.</li>
	<li>Not exactly directly related, but this brings up the fact that we’ve never explicitly defined our skill levels. That’s definitely a thing that’s on our to-do list for the next few months that I think can have a big impact.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<h3 id="definition-practice-experience">Definition</h3>
<p>In my opinion, practice is the most important thing on this list for us to support. Practice is the actual application of all of these methods. Without practice, all of these other systems remain purely theoretical exercises.</p>
<p>The late basketball player Kobe Bryant was a student of the game. He unapologetically <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/kobe-bryant-explains-why-he-stole-michael-jordans-moves-3126228">studied and stole all of Michael Jordan’s moves</a>. But what separated Kobe from all the rest? It wasn’t his talent, even though he was extremely talented. It was his work ethic; <a href="https://www.inc.com/matt-given/this-1-quote-from-kobe-bryant-is-all-you-need-to-know-about-his-success.html">Kobe practiced more than everyone else</a>. That’s why he was better.</p>
<h3 id="how-practice-experience-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>It happens by default. Even though we do provide advisory services to our clients, we’re not just a strategy consultancy. We implement and execute on the work we advise on. That means there are plenty of opportunities for practice.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-practice-experience">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>B (above average).</strong> The question here isn’t whether or not we practice, but <em>what</em> we’re practicing. If it was just about practicing a craft like design or coding, I’d give us an A. But sometimes the thing we should be practicing isn’t obvious. In a scenario where most would design a web page, I want our SuperFriends to practice the discernment that maybe designing a book or an instruction manual would be more useful. What I’d love our SuperFriends to practice more is flexible decision making, not always executing on pre-determined decisions.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-practice-experience">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>Create safer spaces through all of the other support systems in order to allow SuperFriends to practice many other things that support their craft.</p>
<hr>
<p>One quick nuance to point out: I often get confused about the different between mentorship, coaching, modeling, and direction. Here’s a cheat sheet I made for myself about what I think the distinctions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mentorship</strong> is telling people how you’ve done it.</li>
	<li><strong>Coaching</strong> is helping people do it their own way.</li>
	<li><strong>Modeling</strong> is showing people how you’d do it.</li>
	<li><strong>Direction</strong> is telling people what they should do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I’ve decided to grow SuperFriendly, I’ve had to be more explicit about how we can support all of our SuperFriends. As you can see, we definitely don’t have all of this in place, but making a list like this gives us some standards to meet. I have a hypothesis that the best projects contain every one of these support systems.</p>
<p>If your company does any or all of these support systems well, I’d love to hear about it so we can start implementing the same things to create a better experience for our SuperFriends.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoyed writing &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; posts for <a href="/articles/2019-year-in-review/">2019</a> and <a href="/articles/2018-year-in-review/">2018</a>, so I think this is officially a tradition now.</p>

<h2 id="family-home">Family &amp; home</h2>

<p>Our family takes pride in adventuring together, and boy was 2020 an adventure. Our adventures typically involve traveling on planes, but that definitely didn&rsquo;t happen this year.</p> 

<p>Instead, the adventures took the form of being together <em>a lot</em>. 9-year old <a href="https://twitter.com/siddaleemall">Sidda</a> and 7-year old <a href="https://twitter.com/charlottemall">Charlie</a> go to a Catholic school that held in-person classes, but <a href="http://emilymall.me/">Em</a> and I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that, so we opted for virtual school for the first semester to see how the school handled such an unprecedented event. That was difficult. The kids handled it like champs, but introverted Em and I really felt the lack of our own space since we were all home, all the time. We had a welcome reprieve when my parents offered to do school with the kids 2 days a week so they could have some change of scenery and Em and I could get some personal space back.</p>

<p>Parenting kids in virtual school was tough. I pride myself on being pretty digitally savvy, but I just couldn&rsquo;t get my head straight about how and when to submit assignments; what platforms to use between <a href="https://edu.google.com/intl/en/products/classroom/">Google Classroom</a>, <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/">ClassDojo</a>, and others; when to print which handouts for the day, and lots more. I contemplated getting in touch with the school and offering to run all of their digital platform stuff for the kids, parents, and teachers, but taking on something new that big felt just as stressful as dealing with it. So we dealt with it. Em realized that dealing with homework sorting and submitting stressed her out, and I realized that sitting with the kids while in school was frustrating to me while I tried to get work done, so we switched: Em sat with the kids while they were &ldquo;in class,&rdquo; and I took over when school was done and they got into homework time. Come report card time, the kids got mediocre grades, not because they weren&rsquo;t learning the material, but because I didn&rsquo;t submit assignments on time or at the right place. Cue flashbacks of me in school learning all the stuff but not caring enough about the administrivia. Trigger city.</p>


<h2 id="living-room">Living room</h2>

<p>We were doing all of this from home, the old church-turned-house we bought from my parents in 2012. When I was in high school, my parents ran a personal care home business for years as a way to take care of my grandparents while they aged. After my grandparents passed away in 2006 and 2009, my parents no longer needed the business, so they sold it, but they couldn&rsquo;t sell the property because of the poor housing market at the time. When I decided to start SuperFriendly in 2012, Em and I were going to ask my parents if we could move into their basement to keep our expenses low as I started a business for the first time. Before we had the chance, my dad suggested that we could take over the small mortgage left on the property. The house needed work, but paying a modest sum every month was the right kind of pressure we needed while still having a fallback that being late a month or two would be forgiven. Over 9 years, we only missed a mortgage payment once while waiting on late client payments, but knowing that we had some cushion was an incredible privilege.</p>

<p>That house was a blessing and served us incredibly well for almost a decade. But the issues of a poorly-built house were starting to add up over time. Pests, failing appliances, shady neighbors, and other things started to slowly manifest.</p>

<p>The silver lining of quarantining together for months made us realize that we could do anything together. &ldquo;Home&rdquo; could be wherever we wanted it to be, wherever we were together.</p>

<p>So we changed it.</p>

<p>If we were going to be quarantining, we might as well do it in a place we liked. We got a rental apartment on the beach. Our schedule was simple: school in the morning while I worked, homework early afternoon while Em worked, then go sit on the beach together for a few hours while the kids played in the water. That created just the right amount of space for us to feel less pressure; it gave us some room to live.</p>


<h2 id="new-house">A new house</h2>

<p>We moved into our current house since a poor housing market made it tough for my parents to sell otherwise. One of the things that kept us there for as long as we&rsquo;ve been is that we didn&rsquo;t think we get enough money for it to make it worth selling, not to mention beginning the search for a new house, having enough money for a down payment/closing/etc.</p>

<p>And then <abbr title="2019 novel coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 happened.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2020/10/11/covid-19-has-changed-the-housing-market-forever-heres-where-americans-are-moving-and-why/?sh=4d0dcb7361fe">The housing market went nuts</a>. Suddenly, we heard that houses were selling for well above their market value. If we were ever going to sell our house, now seemed to be the time.</p>

<p>A few other things conspired together in our favor. First, we&rsquo;ve been putting money away little-by-little for the past few years in case we wanted to move. We didn&rsquo;t know when or where, but having enough money for a down payment on a decent house gave us some optionality. Then, in Em&rsquo;s occasional Zillow-stalking, she came across an amazing house that wasn&rsquo;t even officially on the market yet. Things happened quickly. We found the house online on October 22, saw it in-person on October 25, put in an offer on October 26, the seller accepted after some light negotiating on October 27, we closed on December 17, and moved in on December 18.</p>

<p>We listed our current house on December 17 and received an offer on December 19 for way more than we ever thought we&rsquo;d get on the house. We&rsquo;re currently waiting on mortgage approval for the buyer but hoping that gets resolved very soon so we can be free and clear.</p>

<p>As we moved into our new house, I found myself wanting to make it nice. I know that might sound obvious, but I realized I never put much effort into making our old house nice. Partially because it wasn&rsquo;t a house we picked and also that it needed a lot of work, I approached it pretty apathetically. I always chalked that up to the fact that I&rsquo;m generally pretty content, but now that we have a <em>nice</em> house, I&rsquo;m surprisingly finding more of a desire to keep it that way. I&rsquo;m nesting hardcore. For the first time, I find myself lost in picking paint colors, watching YouTube videos about minimalist desks, making multiple trips to HomeSense every week, and assembling Pinterest boards of sofas and tables. I kinda like that.</p>

<p>Assuming Sidda and Char leave the nest when they&rsquo;re each 18, that means just about half the time they&rsquo;ll live with us is gone. I want to make sure the other half of that time together is time well spent. I hope this house allows us to do that better.</p>


<h2 id="health-wellness-self-care">Health, wellness, and self-care</h2>

<p>Ha!</p>

<p>2020&rsquo;s been awful for me in terms of physical self-care.</p> 

<p>My soda addiction didn&rsquo;t dwindle at all, as I made 0 attempts to curb it. I just didn&rsquo;t have the willpower to attempt it this year.</p>

<p>I stopped playing in my weekly basketball games in March, and I&rsquo;m pretty sad about that as I&rsquo;ve done very little physical fitness activity other than walking around the neighborhood every few days. Now that I live in a beautiful neighborhood, I think I&rsquo;m going to start running outside even though I hate running. I&rsquo;ll probably give <a href="http://www.c25k.com">Couch to 5K</a> a shot.</p>

<p>The only good thing I can say is that I&rsquo;ve been eating much less fast food as I&rsquo;m really enjoying my <a href="https://eat.cookunity.com/landing-referral?referral_code=danmal96/">CookUnity</a> subscription.</p>

<p>I stopped working with my therapist in July because I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what I was getting out of working with him. I found a new therapist through <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/">BetterHelp</a> and working with her for the last 6 months has been great. However, because I moved to a different state, I had to switch therapists yet again. I&rsquo;ve had one session with her, and so far, I&rsquo;m looking forward to my work with her even more than my previous therapists.</p>

<img src="tattoo.jpg" alt="" />

<p>My brother and I finally got the tattoos we&rsquo;ve been meaning to get for a while now in honor of <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2006/06/26/grandpa.php">our grandfather</a>. This was the last plane ride I took in 2020 was to Portland, <abbr title="Maine">ME</abbr> to get this tattoo, which makes it even extra special.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>I usually have a list of places I&rsquo;ve traveled in the year, but the list is pretty slim for 2020. From January to March, I traveled to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Banff, Canada</li>
	<li>Tulum, Mexico</li>
	<li>Portland, <abbr title="Maine">ME</abbr></li>                    
</ol>

<p>Unusually, all of those places were personal trips, not work trips.</p>

<p>On the bright side, because of the lack of flying this year, I was only <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1225480375541149696">&ldquo;randomly&rdquo; selected for screening</a> twice this year as opposed to 5 times last year.</p>

<p>Although we couldn&rsquo;t fly anywhere this year, our family still tried to take some trips together that were all within driving distance.</p>

<ul>
	<li>We spent a long weekend in Cape May, <abbr title="New Jersey">NJ</abbr> this summer.</li>
	<li>We rented a lake house in Northumberland, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">PA</abbr> for a few days this summer and went tubing and kayaking.</li>
	<li>Em and I took a road trip through New England to see some fall foliage.</li>
	<li>I took the kids to the Adirondacks to see some fall foliage.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we can fly again in 2021, but if not, I have a feeling we&rsquo;ll get creative about scratching that itch.</p>



<h2 id="videos-photos">Videos &amp; photos</h2>

<p>In last year&rsquo;s review, I lamented doing less video stuff than I had anticipated and hoped that some online course ideas would be enough motivation to change that. I was right! I made a 12-video course about design systems called &ldquo;<a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/classes/make-design-systems-people-want-to-use/">Make Design Systems People Want to Use</a>&rdquo; that I wrote, shot, and edited all by myself. I dreaded how long editing takes, but I did underestimate how quickly I could get comfortable in Final Cut Pro after spending some time with YouTube tutorials. Now I don&rsquo;t feel as intimidated about making videos and find myself making fun little 90-second to 2-minute videos of things like preparing a Thanksgiving meal, a silly Christmas play we did a few years ago, or random b-roll from around the house.</p>

<p>On the photography front, I&rsquo;m still as enthusiastic about taking photos as I was a year ago. I started <a href="http://photos.danmall.me/">my photo site</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danmallphotos/">Instagram account</a> around this time last year, and I&rsquo;ve posted about 125 photos to them since. Winter without snow on the East Coast of the United States isn&rsquo;t terribly picturesque, so I find myself longing for a photo trip to a super snowy location or for a soon-to-come photogenic season like cherry blossoms in the spring. I&rsquo;m slowly curating a list of photo trips I&rsquo;d like to take soon. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m still taking a few online courses to get better at this hobby, like <a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/lessons/introduction-to-landscape-photography-with-tiffany-nguyen">Introduction to Landscape Photography with Tiffany Nguyen</a>, <a href="https://learn.proedu.com/products/commercial-composites-with-erik-almas">Composite Photography &amp; Retouching for Advertising by Erik Almas</a>, and <a href="https://fabioantenore.ch/produkt/hyperreal-landscapes-bundle/?lang=en">Hyperreal Landscapes</a>.</p>

<p>I expect to do a lot more photo and video stuff in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="sole-man">Sole man</h2>

<p>I added a few new sneakers to the collection in 2020:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid &ldquo;Racer Pink&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 High Zoom &ldquo;Zen Green&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Union LA x Air Jordan 1 Retro High NRG &ldquo;Storm Blue&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 Mid SE &ldquo;Amarillo&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Puma Rebound LayUp Casual</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 High Zoom &ldquo;Crater&rdquo;</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.whyneo.com/product/neo-x-air-jordan">Custom Air Jordan 1 by Neo</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I also signed up for The Shoe Surgeon&rsquo;s <a href="https://monthly.com/shoe-surgeon-shoemaking">course for creating a custom pair of Jordan 1&rsquo;s</a>. So excited about this one!</p>


<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>

<p>I expected to do way less &ldquo;<a href="/speaking-podcasts/">public appearances</a>&rdquo; in 2020 because of <abbr>COVID</abbr>, but I only did 1 less thing than last year (17 in 2020 as opposed to 18 in 2019):</p>

<ul>
	<li>I <a href="http://www.businessology.biz/show/96/">made an appearance on The Businessology Show</a>, a podcast I helped start with Jason Blumer.</li>
	<li>I talked to folks from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2676560255964391">AIGA Jacksonville</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=582084159146389">the national chapter&rsquo;s portfolio review</a>, where I got to speak alongside people I admire like Lisa Babb, Ellen Lupton, and Michael Bierut.</li>
	<li>I talked design systems <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5obCUoc1o">with Jina Anne</a>, for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-That-UX-ATL/events/267834099/">Ladies that UX ATL</a>, for <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-003-putting-your-components-in-context-dan/id1531717094?i=1000495559139">The Object-Oriented UX Podcast</a>, with the <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/">Bureau of Digital</a>, at <a href="https://2020.uxpl.us/">UX+</a>, and at the <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/designopssummit2020/cohorts/design-systems-and-designops/">Design Ops Summit</a>.</li>
	<li>I talked to Marc Fonteijn twice on the Service Design Show about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtaPFGBnsts">pricing</a> and then again about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ2ppNwT6Ts">design systems for services</a>.</li>
	<li>I emceed <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/2020">Clarity</a>, which was my first time emceeing a conference, and I had a blast!</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s always a treat to doing things with local folks, so I <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/139-dan-mall/id991081339?i=1000471401603">talked to Ryan Starr at Hi-Res about my professional journey</a> and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/so-you-want-to-be-a-successful-ux-practitioner-registration-98794056683#">sat on a panel for PhillyCHI about being a successful UX practitioner</a>.</li>
	<li>I talked to Alexis Collado about <a href="https://rootspodcast.design/podcast/danmall">my experience as a (half) Filipino designer</a> on his Roots podcast.</li>
	<li>I talked to Christian Bryant about <a href="https://stackyack.tv/post/dan-mall-on-collaboration">collaboration</a> on his Stack Yack podcast.</li>
	<li>I <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/let-s-learn-design-systems">publicly taught design systems to Jason Lengstorf</a>, and he enthusiastically wrote <a href="https://www.netlify.com/tags/lets-learn-design-systems/">a 3-part series</a> about our chat!</li>
	<li>I taught a 10-week class about design systems to seniors at Drexel University.</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually have a few events for the following year lined up at this point, but 2020 was weird. I&rsquo;ll be announcing a few public design system workshops shortly, so watch this space if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>


<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>I wrote elsewhere in detail about <a href="/articles/superfriendly-2020-wrap-up/">how SuperFriendly did in 2020</a>, so suffice it to say here that I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for my SuperFriends and my clients. I&rsquo;m excited and hopeful for what we can do in 2021.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also figuring out a way to make more impact while working less, and my family and I can <em>feel</em> it. That&rsquo;s really important to me.</p>

<p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.usearcade.com/">Arcade</a> in 2020 with <a href="https://carbonemike.com/">Mike Carbone</a> and <a href="https://lesliecamacho.com/">Leslie Camacho</a>. It&rsquo;s the third business I&rsquo;ve ever owned/co-owned, so I guess that officially makes me an entrepreneur? We have lots of plans for Arcade in 2021, and we&rsquo;ll be sharing them on the <a href="https://log.usearcade.com/">Arcade blog</a> as we progress.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also likely one more company that I&rsquo;ll hopefully be announcing this year. More on that soon.</p>


<h2 id="#this-site">This site</h2>

<p>In 2020, I published my 500th piece of content to this site, which I&rsquo;ve had for 15 years! I&rsquo;m very grateful to Past Dan&trade; for documenting so much over the years, and I really do wish I had written even more.</p>

<p>I wrote 35 posts in 2020, which is way more than I&rsquo;ve ever posted to this site. (The last highest year was 2019 when I wrote 14 posts.) My favorites from the year were <a href="/articles/better-webcam-video/">documenting my DSLR-as-webcam setup</a> (with <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1301253596705632256">a few updates</a>), <a href="/articles/ceo-covid19-calendar/">tracking my evolving calendar blocking approach</a>, and <a href="/articles/syllabus-for-web-design-development-apprenticeships/">finally making public my syllabus for running a 9-month design or development apprenticeship</a> in case others want to try to create something like it.</p>

<p>Of the 35 posts I wrote in 2020, 31 of them were in the new <a href="https://weeknot.es/">weeknotes</a> format I was trying out. I like this format, partly because it&rsquo;s a nice way for me to see what I do on a weekly cadence and because it gets me writing to my site more frequently. But that also reveals a problem: my <a href="/articles/">Articles</a> page is now mostly weeknotes, which it wasn&rsquo;t really designed for. It buries all the other posts that aren&rsquo;t weeknotes that I&rsquo;d love to highlight more. Cue the plight of all designers/developers with a personal website, especially this time of year: I want a new site.</p>

<p>Sure, I could make a few adjustments to the design to solve the hierarchy problem, but like all sites that have been around for a while, there&rsquo;s a bunch of medium-sized things I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do. A redesign is often a good excuse to bundle all of those individual issues into an actual project. I&rsquo;m proud to have constantly iterated on this site and make small fixes over the years, but it&rsquo;s about time to do some work to make the foundation more sturdy.</p>

<p>The other big reason for a new site is a technical one. I&rsquo;ve had free hosting from <a href="https://mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a> for years, ever since I met some nice MediaTemple folks at <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> one year and they offered to host my site. Then one day earlier this year, my free hosting stopped and I was suddenly on the hook to pay $100/month, which I <em>definitely</em> don&rsquo;t want to pay just to host this site. Just about all of SuperFriendly&rsquo;s work as well as <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">the site</a> is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> now, so this new hosting charge is a good catalyst for getting everything migrated. I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for the free hosting I&rsquo;ve had for years, which is way more than I deserve, but if I&rsquo;m going to pay, I&rsquo;d rather pay for features I value like out-of-the-box SSL/TLS certificates and smart branch deploys as well as a place where all my sites can live together.</p>

<p>Related, I&rsquo;m excited about a new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>. When I put up my first personal site in 2005, I used <code><a href="http://danielmall.com/">danielmall.com</a></code>, because <code>danmall.com</code> wasn&rsquo;t available. I also used the handle <code>@danielmall</code> on Twitter so I could keep my Twitter handle and personal website <abbr>URL</abbr> the same.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m Dan, not Daniel. No one calls me &ldquo;Daniel&rdquo;, except for the people that don&rsquo;t really know me and assume I go by &ldquo;Daniel&rdquo; because of my <abbr>URL</abbr>.</p>

<p>So I switched from <code>@danielmall</code> to <code>@danmall</code> on Twitter a few years ago. And I switched from <code>danielmall.com</code> to <code><a href="http://danmall.me/">danmall.me</a></code>. But I&rsquo;ve never really liked a <code>.me</code> domain for me. Feels unofficial, for some reason.</p>

<p>I check domain registrars every so often for <code>danmall.com</code> to be available. Usually, it&rsquo;s not. But a few weeks ago, I saw it available for purchase, albeit at a pretty premium price. For most big purchases I make, I have a guideline to not buy on the spot but to sleep on it and decide in the morning. That usually keeps my impulse purchases to a minimum. But, as a professional web designer who has waited on this domain for 15 years, I figured this didn&rsquo;t really qualify as impulsive. (Also, business expense!)</p>

<p>So! Whenever I can get around to making it, the new version of this site is finally going to live at <code><a href="https://danmall.com/">danmall.com</a></code>! I was also thinking that I would build the site in public and even make an affordable little course about the process in case anyone&rsquo;s curious about how I design and build a site from scratch. I even have a tagline ready: &ldquo;All the boring stuff you wanted to see.&rdquo;</p>


<h2 id="#miscellany">Miscellany</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Em got <abbr>COVID</abbr> in December. It was pretty scary for a day or two, but luckily it was only that and she recovered to being good as new just in time for our move.</li>
	<li>Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the 2020 U.S. election! I&rsquo;m thrilled to have Trump out of office. I still haven&rsquo;t fully processed this, but I&rsquo;m hoping it means 2021 will be a much kinder year for U.S. citizens.</li>
	<li>I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> ready for the Sixers in 2021. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are joined by Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, coach Doc Rivers, and more. We&rsquo;re gonna win the NBA title this year, and then we&rsquo;re going to win the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="year2021">2021</h2>

<p>Goodbye, 2020. You were good, bad, and ugly.</p>

<p>Ready for 2021.</p>

<p>At the end of 2019, <a href="/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/">I predicted and hoped</a> that 2020 would be a big year for <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know the half of it.</p>

<h2 id="global-pandemic">A global pandemic</h2>

<p>I certainly can&rsquo;t talk about business in 2020 without talking about <abbr title="2019 novel coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19. This global pandemic had a major impact on SuperFriendly this past year, and I&rsquo;m surprised to say almost all effects&mdash;at least the ones that are typically tracked in a spreadsheet&hellip; more on this later&mdash;have been positive. Financially, 2020 was SuperFriendly&rsquo;s best year by far; some of that was because of plans we&rsquo;ve made that manifest this year and some of that was actually <em>because</em> of <abbr>COVID</abbr>. That makes me feel relieved, proud, hopeful, sad, and ashamed, all at the same time. I&rsquo;m conflicted about feeling successful in a year that&rsquo;s been so devastating for so many people on the planet. (I&rsquo;m actively working on this with my therapists and coaches.) What keeps me distracted from being consumed by that emotional conflict is focusing on using SuperFriendly to continue to create better opportunities for our SuperFriends and clients.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, we were working with lots of clients in the travel and hospitality industry, like <a href="https://www.united.com/">United Airlines</a> and <a href="https://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a>. When the pandemic hit in March, those companies had more existential issues to focus on than their work with us (rightly so), so most of that work dried up quickly.</p>

<p>While our travel and hospitality work was dwindling, it&rsquo;s really only by good fortune that our work with healthcare, entertainment, and education clients was ramping up, some actually <em>because</em> of the needs that a global pandemic was causing. For example, our work with clients like <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/">Herman Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Harvard Business School</a> turned toward topics like helping people make a transition to remote work or forming opinions about what events look like in a socially-distanced world. We created &ldquo;response teams&rdquo; to brainstorm with our clients about things that might be helpful to them and their customers, from creating new products and offerings to discounting our own services or offering pro bono work to help them through a tumultuous time.</p>

<p>When people asked me earlier this year how SuperFriendly was doing, my typical response was to include some mention of volatility. <abbr>COVID</abbr> made our business more volatile: more clients were stopping business with us all at once than ever before, but our pipeline was more full than ever too, so it was mostly more activity than we were used to.</p>

<p>Now, at the end of the year, I can say that the volatility has worn off a bit, but our pipeline remains more full than it&rsquo;s ever been and we have more prospects, projects, and accounts lined up for the new year than we&rsquo;ve ever had at the end of a calendar year.</p>


<h2 id="systems-team">The SuperFriendly Systems team</h2>

<p>Those familiar with SuperFriendly for a while probably know the SuperFriend model: I&rsquo;m the only employee (as I&rsquo;ve been since <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/introducing-superfriendly/">I started it in 2012</a>), and every project we do is a custom-assembled team for that client. That said, I&rsquo;m not a fan of using the royal &ldquo;we&rdquo; like many do when talking about their offerings; I try hard to say &ldquo;I&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m talking about what I&rsquo;m doing personally and use &ldquo;we&rdquo; to refer to a larger group of SuperFriends.</p>

<p>When I talk about what we at SuperFriendly did in 2020, I do mean it&rsquo;s the effort of a group of extraordinary people that&rsquo;s more than just me. In the world of enterprises that need and use <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/glossary/#design-system">design systems</a>, a common model is to have dedicated teams working on separate products or features and then having a more central &ldquo;design system team&rdquo; that serves each of the product/feature teams. For SuperFriendly, instead of product teams, we have project/account teams that serve each client, so we established a &ldquo;Systems&rdquo; team in 2020 to serve each of those project/account teams.</p>

<p>On our Systems team, we have roles for representatives from these disciplines: executive, business development, operations, administrative, and legal. They support our project teams in all of these areas. The people that represent each discipline work primarily on SuperFriendly, as opposed to other SuperFriends who work primarily on client work. Without these people, SuperFriendly wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly what it was this year:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.sherlocklegal.com/">Matt Sherlock</a> is SuperFriendly&rsquo;s attorney (and also a friend I&rsquo;ve known since high school). Matt does more than just weigh in on agreements; he regularly advises SuperFriendly and helps shape its direction from a risk profile standpoint and has since 2013.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikki-loffredo-5a8b1945/">Nikki Loffredo</a> handles all of SuperFriendly&rsquo;s administrative needs. She makes it all run smoothly, from bookkeeping, invoicing, reimbursements, travel arrangements, and lots more. She&rsquo;s been a concierge for SuperFriends since 2013.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/crystalvitelli">Crystal Vitelli</a> runs all of SuperFriendly&rsquo;s operations. She acts as a coach and support system for our Producers and Executive Producers. Crystal used to be a SuperFriendly client and has produced SuperFriendly projects since 2016, so she understands both sides of a client relationship better than any other SuperFriend.</li>                    
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/joerinaldi">Joe Rinaldi</a> runs all of SuperFriendly&rsquo;s new business. Just about every dollar that SuperFriendly made in 2020 was at least partially shaped by Joe, if not fully.</li>                    
	<li>I help set direction for the company and provide some shape for some of SuperFriendly&rsquo;s unique services. Most of my time goes to some split of interviewing new SuperFriends, coaching, building teams, shaping and pricing new work, and creating structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these folks, we hold 2 spots open for SuperFriends that primarily work on projects to weigh in on how SuperFriendly can better support teams from that perspective. For the last 6 months, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamlaurendeal/">Lauren Deal</a> and <a href="https://dontaebenn.myportfolio.com/">Dontae Benn</a> have been invaluable in providing their insight on what a good balance between support and autonomy can look like for teams.</p>


<h2 id="superfriendly-in-numbers">SuperFriendly in numbers</h2>

<p>Over to some quantitative fun! Here are some numbers that illustrate parts of what SuperFriendly looked like all year.</p>

<h3 id="time-spent">Time spent</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve generally been a proponent of the &ldquo;work smarter, not harder&rdquo; adage, so I&rsquo;m often looking for ways to spend less time working without much significant impact on my productivity.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2019, I worked <strong>2,040 hours</strong>, an average of <strong>39 hours/week</strong>.</li>
	<li>In 2020, I worked <strong>1,903 hours</strong>, an average of <strong>37 hours/week</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s generally how my detailed time spent breaks down.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Admin:</strong> 372 hours (20%)</li>
	<li><strong>Creative Direction:</strong> 333 hours (17%)</li>
	<li><strong>Business Development:</strong> 277 hours (15%)</li>
	<li><strong>Vacation:</strong> 264 hours (14%)</li>
	<li><strong>Speaking/Conferences:</strong> 178 hours (9%)</li>
	<li><strong>Coaching:</strong> 138 hours (7%)</li>
	<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> 110 hours (6%)</li>
	<li><strong>Design:</strong> 56 hours (3%)</li>
	<li><strong>Writing:</strong> 39 hours (2%)</li>
	<li><strong>Miscellaneous/Other:</strong> 136 hours (7%)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first year since I opened SuperFriendly in 2012 that I spent more time on Administrative things (documentation, reviewing, planning, etc.) than either Creative Direction or Business Development. This affirms and confirms my decision to want to spend more of my effort on SuperFriendly itself than on client work.</p>


<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>We did significantly more projects this year than any other. We average about 9 projects/year. In 2020, we did <strong>19 projects</strong>, a 111% increase from 2019&rsquo;s 9 projects.</p>

<p>We worked on some cool things, like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <a href="https://www.enotes.com/">new site for eNotes</a></li>
	<li>An enterprise-wide design system for <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us">United Airlines</a></li>                    
	<li>A new design language and templates for the University of Pittsburgh that power both their <a href="https://admissions.pitt.edu/">Admissions</a> and <a href="https://financialaid.pitt.edu/">Financial Aid</a> sites</li>
	<li>Some ecosystem strategy work for <a href="https://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a></li>
	<li>Some product prototypes for <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/">Herman Miller</a></li>
	<li>Design system work for <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer</a></li>
	<li>An evolved visual identity for <a href="https://boardable.com/">Boardable</a> that&rsquo;s soon to roll out</li>
	<li>An updated site for the <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/">Digital Initiative</a> at Harvard Business School</li>
	<li>A web application for the State of Maine</li>
	<li>An annual report for the <a href="https://www.steveandalex.org/">Steven &amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation</a></li>
	<li>Work you&rsquo;ll see soon for <a href="https://www.familylife.com/">FamilyLife</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, the <a href="https://faithandliberty.org/">Faith &amp; Liberty Discovery Center</a>, <a href="https://www.point72.com/">Point72</a>, and more</li>
</ul>               


<h3 id="revenue-profit">Revenue &amp; Profit</h3>

<p>SuperFriendly made more gross revenue in 2020 than in any other year. 2019 was the best year to date, and we increased that by 145% in 2020.</p>

<p>However, we only made 11% profit on our revenue in 2020, which is down 17% from the 28% profit margin we had in 2019. I haven&rsquo;t dug in closely enough to know exactly what the cause of that drop was, but my hunch is that our significant increase in overhead this really ate into what would have otherwise been profit. That&rsquo;s definitely something to correct for 2021.</p>





<h3 id="people-purpose">People &amp; Purpose</h3>

<p>I saved the most important one for last.</p>

<p><a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/purpose/">SuperFriendly&rsquo;s purpose</a> is to <strong>create better opportunities for creative people to flourish</strong>. (I&rsquo;ll be revising this in 2021, but more on that another time.) If we have <a href="http://leananalyticsbook.com/one-metric-that-matters/">one metric that matters</a>, it&rsquo;s creating better opportunities, whether that&rsquo;s helping SuperFriends meet financial goals, learn something new, work with a specific client, gain mentorship from more experienced folks, and more.</p>

<p>At the end of 2019, <a href="/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/#purpose-driven-goals">we made a commitment</a> to do a better job in hiring more women, people of color, and other groups of people typically underrepresented in the tech industry. And especially with the murders of George Floyd, Breona Taylor, and many other Black people in 2020 and over the previous few years, we renewed that commitment to creating better opportunities specfically for Black people at SuperFriendly.</p>

<p>Here are some of the specific goals we set last year in who we wanted our SuperFriends to be and how we did against all of them.</p>

<ol>   
	<li>We wanted to hire at least 30 SuperFriends this year. We hired <strong>55 SuperFriends</strong>.</li>
	<li>We wanted to pay all SuperFriends a total of $500,000, an average of just under $17,000 each. We paid SuperFriends <strong>$2,333,039.62</strong>, <strong>an average of $42,418.90 each</strong>.</li>
	<li>We wanted to hire at least 15 women (50% of projected hires). We hired <strong>23 women</strong> (42% of our hires in 2020).</li>
	<li>
		We wanted to hire at least 15 people of color (50% of projected hires). We hired <strong>21 people of color</strong> (38% of our hires in 2020).
		<ul>
			<li>We hired <strong>10 Black people</strong>: 4 women (40%) and 6 men (60%).</li>
			<li>We hired <strong>6 Hispanic people</strong>: 2 women (33%) and 4 men (67%).</li>
			<li>We hired <strong>4 Asian people</strong>: 3 women (75%) and 1 man (25%).</li>
			<li>We hired <strong>1 Middle Eastern woman</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of all of those things! But there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done and things to fix here. For example, we paid 12 SuperFriends above our average of $42,418.90. Of those 12: 10 are white, and 10 are men. So, while we&rsquo;ve done a better job of hiring more women and people of color, having them be on the lower end of our pay scale isn&rsquo;t enough. In 2021, I want to be able to say our highest paid SuperFriends are women and people of color. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how we&rsquo;re going to do that yet, but I&rsquo;ll be working on that immediately.</p>


<h3 id="superfriendly-in-2021">SuperFriendly in 2021</h3>

<p>One of the biggest changes I&rsquo;m going to work on is around culture. In 2020, SuperFriends spent a lot of time focusing on how to do good work/good projects. That&rsquo;s nice, but they didn&rsquo;t focus as much on how to work together better. We spent too much time on the &ldquo;project&rdquo; part and not enough time on the &ldquo;people&rdquo; part. I think some of that is the default culture of freelancing, which is inherently tied into our model. Unlike an agency where you get hired full-time, freelancers default into the &ldquo;hired gun&rdquo; mentality where you come in, do your job with your head down, and fly out. I want SuperFriendly to be about teams. I want it to be a place where freelancers can rely on others but can still exercise the value of being independent that attracted them to freelancing in the first place. We haven&rsquo;t done a good job of creating the environment for that, so I&rsquo;ll be actively working on that in 2021.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not across the board though; 2 of our teams did a particularly good job with not just acting like a bunch of freelancers but actually being a team. One of our teams saw their project come to a halt because of <abbr>COVID</abbr>, but the bond they created lasted long after their project was over. Another one of our teams was very intentional about developing their own team culture. They created their own team shirts, regularly eat together over Zoom, and build each other up on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s no surprise that this team&rsquo;s work is some of the most exciting at SuperFriendly right now.</p>

<p>In short, we didn&rsquo;t spend enough time on people in 2020. (And partially justified too; for some, &ldquo;doing a good job&rdquo; was all they had to offer in 2020, and that&rsquo;s absolutely enough.) Still though, 2021 will be about SuperFriends. We haven&rsquo;t done a great job of sharing much lately about our process, our work, our values, and our purpose. A big project for me in 2021 will be to share more about how we do things, recruit even more SuperFriends, and create a culture where taking risks is safe and fun.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad 2020 is over and I&rsquo;m also grateful to have gone through it in a way that could still create great opportunities for SuperFriends.</p>

<p>Bring on 2021.</p>

<ul>
	<li>When I focus on a smaller number of things, I work more. When I have a lot of little things to do, I work less. I wonder if lots of little things fatigue me, as opposed to a smaller number of big things.</li>
	<li>I tend to work more when I&rsquo;m enjoying myself or am excited about something. This week, I was excited about launching the course, and I started on a side project I&rsquo;ve been mulling over in my head for months.</li>
	<li>I tend to see holiday weeks as weeks I can focus on my own things. I wonder if that means I see &ldquo;normal&rdquo; weeks as ones where I&rsquo;m obligated to do something instead of pursuing. I&rsquo;d like to figure out how to carve out more time each week to work on the stuff I want to.</li>

	<li>Worked 61 hours (on a holiday week!)</li>                    
	<li>In posting my daily standup, I started to rank each task as good, neutral, or bad against how I felt about it the day after. Hoping this gives me a better sense of what I really enjoy doing vs. what I could do without.</li>
	<li>I launched a new course: <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/classes/make-design-systems-people-want-to-use/">Make Design Systems People Want to Use</a>!</li>

	<li>Twitter released Fleets this week. I thought I didn&rsquo;t like the Story format, but I&rsquo;m realizing it&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t fit my usage of other social media. I use Facebook and Instagram for friends and family only, and I&rsquo;m much more guarded about the content I share there. But, I use Twitter more casually as well as professionally and have a lot more to share via that platform. I could see myself using Fleets a lot.</li>

I like starting new phones fresh as opposed to restoring from backup so that I only have the apps that I need. Here&rsquo;s the short list of apps I manually added back to my phone:

<h2 id="personal">Personal <a href="#personal">#</a></h2>

<ol>
	<li>I made the decision to <em>not</em> homeschool the kids this year and instead have them learn virtually at their current Catholic school. It seems like most of the kids in their classes are attending school in-person, and, as I&rsquo;ve run a fully distributed team for 8 years, I&rsquo;m a bit worried about the problem of the majority of the class being in-person with my kids and possibly only a handful more being remote. I&rsquo;ve seen that lead to a much more diminished experience for the remote ones as they tend to be forgotten. I&rsquo;ll be vigilantly keeping an eye on this.</li>
	<li>Our power went out twice this week because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Isaias">Hurricane Isaias</a>. Luckily, it came back on seconds after it went out each time. </li>
	<li>Em and I got takeout from <a href="https://www.pizzeriabeddia.com/">Pizzeria Beddia</a>, <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2019/04/10/pizzeria-beddia-fishtown-philadelphia/">formerly the Best Pizza in America</a>.</li>
	<li>My current computer (2016 15-inch MacBook Pro) has been randomly turning off every few days. Because it&rsquo;s the main source of my income, I begrudgingly&mdash;and also kinda excitedly&mdash;decided to get a new computer (2020 16-inch MacBook Pro) so that I&rsquo;ll always have two computers as insurance. I&rsquo;m struggling a bit with balancing the feelings that having not one but two expensive supercomputers seems excessive and indulgent but also simultaneously smart and safe.</li>
	<li>
		On a related note to the new computer, I tried to carve out several days to get the it up and running, but it only took a few hours. I like starting computers from scratch every time rather than restoring from any backups, and here&rsquo;s the short list of apps I installed (in this order) that made the new computer feel like home very quickly:

	<li>The internet was out for about a day and a half because of a power outage. I felt very frustrated about not being able to get much done, but I actually ended up getting a lot more done because of it.</li>
	<li>Related to the above point, Crystal helped me figure out how to push off or cancel most of my meetings, so I was really productive. It&rsquo;s interesting to me that my list (<a href="#work">above</a >) was shorter this week than normal&mdash;I only had 17 items as opposed to my average of about 25&ndash;30&mdash;but I got a lot more important things (as opposed to urgent things) done. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s a correlation between the number of items in my list and my feelings of accomplishment.</li>
	<li>Stopped working with my therapist of 2+ years</li>

	<li>Tried to photograph <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/how-to-see-comet-neowise/">Comet Neowise</a> again, and again to no avail. The sky was too cloudy the night I went out, but I brought <a href="https://twitter.com/charlottemall">Charlie</a> along with me this time and we had a blast being silly, eating chips, and driving around our town and searching the sky late at night. She&rsquo;s a good adventure partner.</li>

<h2 id="personal">Personal <a href="#personal">#</a></h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		The world erupted this week with protests and riots over the murder of George Floyd by police officers, another death in a long string of police brutality against Black people. I&rsquo;m still processing what I can do to contributing to making it so that this never happens again. I know I can start by condemning this and speaking out against racism, and I&rsquo;m to put processes in place that make sure it doesn&rsquo;t just end with that for me. Some specific steps I&rsquo;m trying:
		<ul>
			<li>I made it a personal policy to only retweet Black people this week (probably going to do this for longer)</li>
			<li>Withdrawing from and not agreeing to speak at conferences that aren&rsquo;t committed to inclusion specifically for Black people and showing it by having as many Black speakers as any other group represented.</li>
			<li>Some major changes at SuperFriendly (more details to come)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This is also the week that our county moves to yellow phase of our governor&rsquo;s COVID-19 reopening plan. Our neighbors across the street had a big birthday party. I&rsquo;m approaching all of this way more conservatively and still trying to quarantine and wear masks outside as much as possible, while balancing that with still easing into re-integrating with the rest of society.</li>
	<li>Replaced old bike tires with new ones myself in order to go bike riding as a family. This sounds like an insignificant point, but as someone who is <em>not</em> handy and is uncomfortable around even simple tools like wrenches, I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of this.</li>
	<li>Slept an average of 4 hours and 48 minutes per night. Average bedtime: 10:46pm. Average wake up time: 5:07am. I typically sleep pretty well, and I&rsquo;m not often aware of whether or not I&rsquo;m stressed. My lower than average sleep amount is one way I can realize that something&rsquo;s not right with me.</li>

		</author>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From 2012&ndash;2019, I ran a 9-month apprenticeship at <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a> for people new to design and development that wanted to make their way into the tech industry. I&rsquo;ve previously written about <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/"><em>why</em> apprenticeships are valuable</a> and <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/#academy"><em>what</em> format I used</a>; here are the details about <em>how</em> I ran them.</p>

<p>Within that 7-year span, I had almost 20 apprentices. Some finished the apprenticeship; some didn&rsquo;t. Some got full-time jobs in the discipline they pursued during their apprenticeship. Some took the skills they learned in their apprenticeship and applied them to a tangential industry. Some went freelance or started their own companies. Some went back to doing what they did before the apprenticeship.</p>

<p>As I write this information for the first time, I&rsquo;m realizing in hindsight how valuable documenting this earlier would have been for me and even moreso for my apprentices. I&rsquo;m partially writing all of this down as a resource for myself in case I ever bring the apprenticeship back again.</p>

<p lang="fr">C&lsquo;est la vie.</p> 

<p>The final 3 months of my apprenticeship focused on preparing the apprentice for a job elsewhere, so, in terms of describing a replicable format, I&rsquo;ll focus the syllabus specifically on the first 6 months (180 days).</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>To unlock a new way of life for the apprentice through emergently gaining knowledge of web design and/or web development and the accompanying industry.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Computer proficiency.</strong> As little prior knowledge about design and development is preferred, as most of it would likely have to be untaught. If you can already make a design or development portfolio, you&rsquo;re over-qualified for this apprenticeship.</li>
	<li>Because this apprenticeship focuses on those <em>interested</em> in getting into tech, I host a several-week <strong>prelude</strong> to the apprenticeship. I ask each prospective apprentice to come to the office for 2&ndash;4 hours per day. I assign various reading and watching, from books to online articles to conference talks to YouTube videos. I also encourage them to observe the work that&rsquo;s currently happening in the office and to take notes on words and acronyms that sound unfamiliar, and we spend time discussing what&rsquo;s happening and why. If this is going to be a full-time career, I want the apprentice to have the chance to see what that could look like and try to envision themselves in that role. For many apprentices, it will be their first time in a desk job and/or sitting in front of a computer for an extended amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Laptop</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the apprenticeship, in-person attendance at SuperFriendly <abbr title="Headquarters">HQ</abbr> 4&ndash;5 days a week from 10<abbr title="Ante meridien">am</abbr>&ndash;4<abbr title="Post meridien">pm</abbr> is required. During the second and third units of the apprenticeship, in-person attendance can decrease and independent remote work can increase.</p>

<p>(Because so much of the learning comes from passive observation, reflection, and real-time discussion, I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to make a remote apprenticeship work as well as an in-person one, so to date it has never been an option that I offered.)</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>Every assignment comes with a conversation covering these kinds of questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What was easy?</li>
	<li>What was difficult?</li>
	<li>What did you learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers to these questions help shape the individual learning and direction each apprenticeship takes.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="days1-30">Days 1&ndash;30</h2>

<p>The first month is basic training: dipping toes into the foundational skills in being a web professional. Whether intending to concentrate on design or development, every apprentice starts with an introduction to both design and code as understanding both of these things are crucial to being a competent web professional. This first month is intended to provide exposure, not necessarily build proficiency.</p>


<h2 id="days31-90">Days 31&ndash;90</h2>

<p>After the first month, an apprentice is encouraged to choose an area of focus between design and development. Learning much more follows the interests of the apprentice, so there&rsquo;s less of a stated curriculum available as it shifts to being more self-directed. Learning includes topics that broadly address professionalism, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/articles/how-to-scope-work/">Scoping work</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">Pricing</a></li>
	<li>Writing proposals and pitches</li>
	<li>Project management methodologies</li>
</ul>




<h3 id="design-concentration">Design concentration</h3>

<p>For those more interested in design, we do more copying and remixing assignments. The assignments progressively increase in complexity and intend to increase fluency with design tools and design solutions. The design apprentice should grow more confident solving challenges like drawing more attention to a particular piece of content, knowing if a design is accomplishing its job, shifting the mood of any particular design, and more.</p>

<p>Typical topics covered within this time period may include the following as they&rsquo;re of interest to the apprentice:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Typography</li>
	<li>Art history movements</li>
	<li>Illustration</li>
	<li>Branding</li>                        
	<li>Image formats &amp; optimization</li>
	<li><abbr title="Two dimensional">2D</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Three dimensional">3D</abbr> Animation</li>
	<li><abbr>3D</abbr> modeling</li>
	<li>Motion graphics</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="development-concentration">Development concentration</h3>

<p>For those more interested in development, each assignment intends for the apprentice to build more and better than they could before.</p>

<p>If the first assignment is to build 1 unstyled web page, the final assignment before moving on to real project work may be to build a fully-functioning, multi-page website with both client-side and server-side logic. Every assignment between builds up to that point, and the path taken for each assignment is to both reinforce good skills as well as address weaknesses that could use more practice from the previous assignments.</p>

<p>Typical topics covered within this time period may include the following as they&rsquo;re of interest to the apprentice:</p>

<ul>
	<li><abbr>CSS</abbr> animation</li>
	<li>Content management systems</li>
	<li>Package management</li>
	<li>Image formats &amp; optimization</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li><abbr title="Application programming interface">API</abbr>s</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="day90">Day 90</h2>

<p>Every 90 days, each apprentice does an evaluation. We go through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ac35UED5359vEUVGFlYdsDbKE3dtIvd0mvb-wlXNRXw/edit?usp=sharing">a review sheet</a> as a way to calibrate how closely their plan of study matches against what they want to as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<h2 id="days91-180">Days 91&ndash;180</h2>

<p>After the first 3 months, a pre-defined syllabus is almost impossible to use. Apprentices are usually ready to join real projects with larger teams, and lessons learned are a direct result of the specific projects available and greatly vary from apprentice to apprentice. Because of this inevitable variation, it&rsquo;s important that both the mentor and apprentice be continually focused on the specific skills the apprentice wants to advance. Some apprentices enter with stronger back-end skills than front-end skills or a stronger ability to execute user interface designs rather than present well in a meeting. That&rsquo;s an advantage of the apprenticeship model of learning rather than following a more structured learning plan like a online course or university major, so the apprenticeship style should be utilized to its advantage.</p>

<p>All assignments tend to give the apprentice some sphere of ownership, although that ownership is very limited in earlier days and much more broader as they approach the end of their apprentice. For example, an apprentice who is new to real project work may only be in charge of the footer&rsquo;s design or code, while an apprentice at the end of their apprenticeship may be in charge of designing or developing a whole section of a site or app or even the entire thing.</p>


<h2 id="day180">Day 180</h2>

<p>If paced well&mdash;which is the responsibility of both the mentor <em>and</em> the apprentice&mdash;the end of this 180-day period should give the apprentice at least 3 examples (read: <a href="/articles/portfolios/">portfolio pieces</a>) that show the broadest scope of what that apprentice can confidently handle on a project.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a good sense of what went into the first 6 months of the SuperFriendly apprenticeship. If you&rsquo;re considering starting one of your own, or even if you have an existing one, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to take any parts of what I&rsquo;ve done here and integrate or remix it into your curriculum. But if you do, please share that publicly too!</p>

		</author>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;ve previously written about <a href="https://superyesmore.com/a-new-calendar-approach-for-2017-19258660a431179c7fa3b281b2fe4ab7">how I manage my calendar</a> in order to be productive. Here&rsquo;s an update to that.</p>         

<p>Why update? A few things have changed since I made that original schedule:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&rsquo;ve really embraced being <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a>&rsquo;s <abbr>CEO</abbr> lately, as opposed to being a practitioner that&rsquo;s the de facto <abbr>CEO</abbr> of a sole proprietorship. That means my focus has changed from trying to create great work myself to creating an ideal environment for others to do great work. As I transition from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">being primarily a maker to being primarily a manager</a>, I no longer have to protect certain time in the same way.</li>
	<li>Related to the previous point, I haven&rsquo;t been working actively on any SuperFriendly project myself in about 6 months (with a few small exceptions from time to time). I hinted at this at the end of 2019 in my thoughts about <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/">what was in store for SuperFriendly in 2020</a> and in <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/2019-year-in-review/#work">my personal 2019 year in review</a>, but I think my season of being a creative director, designer, and developer for clients is officially over. I&rsquo;ll still be practicing my design and development skills to keep them somewhat sharp, but that&rsquo;ll mostly be on internal and personal projects. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever return to client work, but I&rsquo;m currently <em>much</em> more interested and energized by the design challenges that growing a business and growing teams bring. My calendar should reflect that shift in priorities.</li>
	<li>In an attempt to have an intentional balance of both isolated work and meetings times, I previously time blocked time for both each day: 2 hours for meetings, 3 &frac12; hours for isolated work. But it was too easy to those 3 &frac12; work hours to turn into 2 or 1 because a meeting would run long, I&rsquo;d be distracted by something else, or it was just hard to task <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/switch-creative-block/">switch</a> fast enough.</li>
	<li>A global pandemic happened (and is still happening). My kids are home all day. The type of work that SuperFriendly is doing has changed, our approach to work as changed, and our pace of work changed.</li>
</ul>               

<p>Here&rsquo;s what my new schedule looks like.</p>

<div class="dm-u-marginTop--m dm-u-marginBottom--m">
	<a href="http://danmall.me/articles/ceo-covid19-calendar/dmall-calendar-2020.svg"><img src="http://danmall.me/articles/ceo-covid19-calendar/dmall-calendar-2020.svg" alt="Dan Mall&rsquo;s 2020 daily schedule" /></a>
</div>

<p>Some details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>With the exception of an hour or so of mission work when I wake up, I spend the morning with my kids, getting them ready for the day and doing their school Zoom calls and schoolwork. This also gives my wife the first half of the day to have <a href="http://emilymall.me/2020/05/05/the-12-week-artists-way-challenge-week-1/">her own flow time</a>.</li>
	<li>
		Rather than trying to make time for both isolated work and meetings every day, I&rsquo;ve consolidated and limited meetings to Tuesdays and Fridays and given myself Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays for isolated work. Moving from hourly blocking to daily blocking gives me more focused time for each type of task. It&rsquo;s also easier to remember that &ldquo;Tuesday is meeting day&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;1:30&ndash;2:30 is meeting time.&rdquo;
		<ul>
			<li>Across Tuesdays and Fridays, I&rsquo;ve given myself up to 10 meetings slots of 50 minutes each. This means I can spend time with up to 10 SuperFriends weekly in 1-on-1s, which <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1233860402481631233">my weeknotes</a> show me is increasingly more of a priority for me. I&rsquo;m hoping to keep the limit of the people I directly manage in the 6&ndash;8 range that former Intel <abbr>CEO</abbr> Andy Grove suggested in his legendary book, <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2LqYjdh">High Output Management</a></cite>.</li>
			<li>Even though I don&rsquo;t need flow time to design and develop things for clients, I still highly value protecting this time. Since I&rsquo;ve switched to this kind of schedule, I&rsquo;ve used this flow time for creating new products and services ideas for SuperFriendly, writing, reading, giving myself space for some thinking, and more.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Exercise time has completely disappeared. With COVID-19, my regular 1&ndash;2 times a week of basketball is non-existent, which was the majority of my exercise. I don&rsquo;t know where to put that yet, though I suspect it may be something I do some mornings with the kids.</li>
</ul>

<p>My previous system worked really well for me until it didn&rsquo;t. So far, I&rsquo;m liking this system a lot. Even if things go &ldquo;back to normal&rdquo; and the kids go <a href="https://6abc.com/pennsylvania-schools-reopen-closed-pa-will-in-fall/6175049/">back to school in the fall</a>, I may still keep this schedule, or something similar to it. I&rsquo;ve found very little difference in productivity in currently working 25&ndash;30 hours per week as opposed to my previous 35&ndash;45 hours per week. In fact, I may be <em>more</em> productive now&mdash;and happier with what I&rsquo;m doing too.</p>

<p>In running a <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">completely distributed agency</a>, I spend a signficant portion of my day on video calls. Like, most days, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1214314833698578437">the majority of my day</a>. So, if my colleagues and I have to spend a lot of time looking at my mug, I might as well try to make that a more pleasant experience for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The initial inspiration for this goes to <a href="https://aaronshekey.com/">Aaron Shekey</a >. I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronshekey/status/1042838954532327427">a tweet of his that talked about switching from a built-in webcam to a proper camera</a>, and I was immediately off to research how to do this. Luckily, he wrote <a href="https://aaronshekey.com/posts/video-conferencing-with-a-proper-camera/">a post about his setup</a>, and I&rsquo;m doing most of the things he is, with a few minor modifications. Thanks for all of this, Aaron!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my desk setup and all the equipment I use:</p>

</ul>

<p>I use an Olympus mirrorless camera for my webcam with a pancake lens that has a pretty wide aperture (f/1.7) so I can get some pretty shallow depth of field.</p>

<p>The camera is pretty light&mdash;which is part of the reason I got this particular camera in the first place&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not light enough to sit on top of a monitor like a typical external webcam. So, I use a tabletop tripod to hold it steady, which also has the added benefit of being able to position it at the exact height as well as place on my desk that I want. Since it&rsquo;s next to my laptop where I typically leave my video call screen (usually <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> but occasionally <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>), it appears to people on the call that I&rsquo;m looking slightly offscreen. I could look directly into the camera, but then I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see the people I&rsquo;m talking to, which is what I prefer. I may tweak this setup in the future to see if I can achieve both simultaneously.</p>

<p>The Elgato Cam Link with HDMI to Micro HDMI cable is what makes all of this possible. (If you&rsquo;re using a different camera, be aware that you might need a HDMI to <em>Mini</em> HDMI cable instead of a HDMI to <em>Micro</em> HDMI cable.) Once it&rsquo;s set it, you can switch to this camera as a video input just like you would any other webcam (built into a monitor or external).</p>

<p>I typically get about 1&frac12; &ndash; 2 hours of straight video time, which is pretty decent. But, since I&rsquo;m on video calls a lot, I always have 2 spare batteries charging for a quick swap in case a battery dies in the middle of a call.</p>

<p>My studio typically gets a lot of light, so I&rsquo;m rarely in need of additional lighting to make this setup work. However, for the rare evening video calls, I&rsquo;ll switch on a Lume Cube mounted behind my external monitor, which does just the trick.</p>

<p>I leave my camera on manual focus. That means when I first join calls, I have to manually adjust the focus ring on my lens to make sure <a href="http://rising.blackstar.com/for-great-portraits-shoot-the-eyes.html">my eyes are sharply focused</a>. (This is why I always keep &ldquo;Always show video preview dialog when joining a video meeting&rdquo; enabled by default. Letting people see themselves before you see them is just common courtesy.) I tried using autofocus for a while, but the camera didn&rsquo;t always get the focus right, and I spent a disproportionate amount of time on calls trying to reset the focus, distracting me from the what I actually wanted to focus on: the conversation.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a comparison between the images that come out of each screen (each screenshot taken from the same Zoom window seconds apart from each other in the same lighting conditions for the most accurate representation):</p>

<p>From my MacBook Pro built-in FaceTime camera:</p>

<img src="macbook.png" alt="Video call image from MacBook Pro built-in FaceTime camera" />

<p>From my <a href="https://amzn.to/2UFf363">LG 27&quot; UltraFine 5k monitor</a> built-in camera:</p>

<img src="lg.png" alt="Video call image from LG 27&quot; UltraFine 5k monitor built-in camera" />

<p>From my Olympus camera:</p>

<img src="olympus.png" alt="Video call image from Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II" />

<p>And just for kicks while I was at it, I made a silly in-situ image that displays when my video is turned off:</p>

<img src="shh-sunglasses--small.jpg" alt="Placeholder image for when video is turned off" />

<p>Is all of this worth it? I think so! While some of this is certainly ego and vanity, it&rsquo;s also a form of self-care for me. I think the better I think I look, the more confident I feel. And when I feel good, I act good. Without a doubt, that&rsquo;s worth a couple hundred bucks and a few hours of setup.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoyed writing <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/">last&rsquo;s year in review</a> as it was a good way to assess the year and look forward to the next one. Naturally, here&rsquo;s one for 2019!</p>

<h2>A decade in review</h2>

<p>As we ring in the new year and new decade, it seems like a good time to for me to look back at the last year and decade and take inventory.</p>

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://emilymall.me/">Em</a > and I left Philly where she had lived for over a decade and I had lived for most almost two decades to try on New York as one of our first big adventures as a married couple.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2009/07/16/cogs_and_spaceships.php">left a dream job</a> at <a href="https://www.happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a>, turned down a dream offer from Facebook, a took another dream job at <a href="https://www.bigspaceship.com/">Big Spaceship</a>. (And yes, I know how privileged I am to have any one of those things, much less all three. I don&rsquo;t take any of it for granted. I have nothing but extreme gratitude in my heart for all of those opportunities and do my best to pass it on and provide the same opportunities for as many others as possible.)</p>

<p>On this day in 2009, I awoke to 7 missed calls from my Mom, saying my Grandma passed away peacefully in her sleep. I miss her terribly every day, but the hundreds of memories I have of her make me smile every time I think of her.</p>

<p>In the decade since, we&rsquo;ve moved back to Philly with renewed fervor for the city, <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/leaving-four24/">quit my band</a>, created two spectacular daughters, <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/introducing-superfriendly/">started an agency</a>, started (and left) <a href="http://www.businessology.biz/">a podcast</a>, <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">wrote a book</a>, started (and left) <a href="https://superbooked.com/">a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> product</a>, ate some delicious food, and traveled around the world.</p>

<p>I live an incredibly blessed life, and I guard it relentlessly.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened in the last year.</p>

<h2>Eleven</h2>

<p role="text">Em and I celebrated our 11th anniversary in 2019! We were going to throw a big bash called the <span aria-hidden="true">Ma11 Ba11</span><span class="dm-u-move--offscreen"> Mall Ball</span>&mdash;get it?&mdash;but then we realized that it would really stress out these two introverts to plan and throw a giant party and that we&rsquo;d much rather travel together. So we spent a long weekend in Cuba instead!</p>

<h2>Kids &amp; family</h2>

<p>Overall, our family had lots of fun adventures together in 2019. Sidda and Charlie are now 8 years old and 6 years old respectively. There&rsquo;s lots of interesting things to share about them, but I&rsquo;m also increasingly more inclined to keep their personal details private. Suffice it to say that the older they get, the more I&rsquo;m enjoying being their dad. And the more the four of us grow together,the deeper and more interesting and exciting our family relationship gets. It&rsquo;s easy at times and difficult at times, and I&rsquo;m lucky to be a part of all of it.</p>

<h2>Max</h2>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/2019-year-in-review/max.jpg" alt="Max" />

<p>We got a dog! This is our second try with dogs: we had to give our Rottweiler puppy to a friend after not even a week as we discovered our family was allergic. We also had cats this time last year, but same deal: allergies meant we had to give them away. We tried fish too, but they died.</p>

<p>But Max is a Yorkshire Terrier, which apparently is a hypoallergenic breed since they have hair (not fur) and don&rsquo;t shed. We&rsquo;ve had him for a little over a month now without any major issue, so it seems like he&rsquo;s a keeper.</p>

<p>As someone who didn&rsquo;t have pets growing up and is kinda afraid of dogs, it&rsquo;s definitely an adjustment. Since I shut down my apprenticeship last year, my office is usually pretty quiet and lonely now, but Max is a great office buddy. He gives me lots of reasons to step away from work every so often to play. I do wish I could entertain him more than I do. He mostly sleeps all day, but for a puppy, I&rsquo;d imagine he&rsquo;d like to be more active.</p>


<h2>Health, wellness, and self-care</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been drinking a lot more water this year, thanks to always having my <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-flex/color,lava,a,92,o,54">HydroFlask</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2tjcV8p">Coca-Cola tumblers</a> filled with ice water nearby. I thought this would help me drink less soda, but alas, I&rsquo;m still as addicted to cola as ever. (IT&rsquo;S SO DELICIOUS.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that I&rsquo;m still playing basketball regularly, an average of once every two weeks. An ankle sprain about 2 months ago has put me out of commission recently, but I&rsquo;m <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1211726228979355648">slowly getting back into athletic activity again</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;m really happy about is that I&rsquo;m eating at home more now. I really enjoy cooking, but very rarely do I block out the time to do it. So, I end up defaulting to fast food a lot. Over the last 6 months, however, subscriptions to meal services <a href="https://my.tovala.com/referral/JPP5WDZR">Tovala</a> and <a href="https://eat.cookunity.com/landing-referral?referral_code=danmal96/">CookUnity</a> have got me eating quick and delicious meals, and I&rsquo;m also saving a little money every month too.</p>

<p><a href="http://danmall.me/articles/my-experience-with-laser-eye-surgery/">I finally got laser eye surgery</a> this year. <abbr title="Too long; didn&rsquo;t read">TL;DR</abbr>: if you can deal with a first few hours of inconvenience, it&rsquo;s awesome. Almost one year later, I&rsquo;m really loving the little things, like forgetting to bring contact solution on a trip or worrying about a contact lens getting bumped out while playing sports.</p>

<p>I wanted to get my second tattoo this year, but it didn&rsquo;t happen. But! It&rsquo;s definitely happening in 2020. I have the appointment already booked, and bonus: my brother and I are gonna get the same one together.</p>

<p>I started therapy again this year after about a year-long break. It&rsquo;s been helpful at times, but I think I need to be clearer with myself (and my therapist) about what I want out of it.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

	<li><cite>The Circle</cite>, by Dave Eggers (currently reading)</li>
</ol>

<p>I gave myself a lot more permission to not finish books this year. I think this comes from a combination of 2 things:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2016/08/i-buy-more-books-than-i-read/">I Buy More Books Than I Read</a>, Shawn Blanc says, &ldquo;All I care about is getting one good idea or story from that book. If I get that, then it&rsquo;s worth it to me&hellip; A life- and business-changing idea for $10 or less? Sold.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Audible has <a href="https://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4592/~/can-i-return%2Fexchange-my-book%3F">a very generous return policy</a>: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your book, you can return or exchange it easily as long as it&rsquo;s within 365 days of the original purchase. Our exchange policy is risk-free. It allows active members to take a chance on a new narrator or story without losing a credit. Our ability to continue to offer this benefit is dependent on our members using it for this purpose only.&rdquo; Because of this generosity, I return audiobooks liberally while being conscious about whether or not I&rsquo;m abusing this policy, but I also purchase audiobooks liberally too. This kind of policy feels like it&rsquo;s coming from a company that respects its customers, and I&rsquo;m happy to reward that kind of company with my business.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>This year, for both work and personal reasons, I got to visit:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Chicago, <abbr title="Illinois">IL</abbr></li>
	<li>Austin, <abbr title="Texas">TX</abbr></li>
	<li>Seattle, <abbr title="Washington">WA</abbr></li>
	<li>Breckenridge, <abbr title="Colorado">CO</abbr> (first time)</li>
	<li>Los Angeles, <abbr>CA</abbr></li>
	<li>Havana, Cuba (first time)</li>
	<li>Boston, <abbr title="Massachusetts">MA</abbr></li>                    
	<li>Scotland (first time)</li>
	<li>San Jose, <abbr>CA</abbr></li>
	<li>Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (first time)</li>
	<li>San Francisco, <abbr>CA</abbr></li>
	<li>New York, <abbr title="New York">NY</abbr></li>
	<li>Orlando, <abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr></li>
</ol>

<p>All of my international trips this year were the first times in each of those locations, and were all leisure trips with Em and friends. I had already previously been to every <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> city I visited this year (except Breckenridge). There are a lot of places in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> I haven&rsquo;t been, and I feel myself getting the itch for an road trip around the country. Perhaps that&rsquo;s in the cards for the next few years.</p>

<h2>Videos &amp; photos</h2>

<p>In last year&rsquo;s review, I mentioned that I had &ldquo;caught the video bug&rdquo; and that I&rsquo;d be posting a lot more videos this year.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>I did <em>shoot</em> a lot more video this year, but I didn&rsquo;t really post many because, well, they suck. I&rsquo;ve been shooting a lot more videos with my <abbr title="Digital Single Lens Reflex">DSLR</abbr>, mirrorless, and GoPro, but I don&rsquo;t like any of them. And geez, editing takes <em>so long</em>. I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;m willing to put the time in to get good at this. I&rsquo;m not completely writing it off, but I&rsquo;m also not exactly enthusiastic about it. I do have a few ideas for online courses I&rsquo;d like to make, so perhaps that&rsquo;ll be the motivation that gets me over the hump.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I did have a lot of renewed interest in photography this year. I think the change started last year when I attended the <a href="https://f8workshops.com/faroe-islands-april-2018">f/8 Photography Workshop in the Faroe Islands</a>. The weather conditions and subjects made it ideal for taking great photos, and I learned so much from the great instructors about both editing and shooting.</p>

<p>This year, I took two online courses that I found through Instagram (I&rsquo;m such a sucker for Instagram ads):</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://expertphotography.com/store/courses/p11-photography-for-beginners/">Photography for Beginners</a>, by Josh Dunlop at Expert Photography. I learned to shoot in a high school photography class on a manual camera that was either my mom&rsquo;s or came from a flea market, which gave me a decent enough understanding of the mechanics of shooting. But I never really practiced enough to get really good at it. Even though a lot of this course was review for me, it covered all of the gaps of things I missed in the transition from using a manual camera to a digital one over the last 20 years.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.learn.photographyacademy.com/webclass">Photography Academy</a>, by Tim Shields. I really love Tim&rsquo;s simple approach to teaching photography. He explains things slowly and thoroughly without coming off patronizing or like he&rsquo;s dumbing it down. He suggests that there are only two things important about photography: getting sharp images and getting proper exposure. His courses are about many different but still simple ways to achieve those two goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my shooting even while taking these courses, my images improved dramatically. As a designer, I&rsquo;m pretty experienced at taking even the worst images and making them look good. I realized that the photos I was taking weren&rsquo;t good; I was just good and making them look good afterwards. But with the tips I picked up over the last two years, the images coming out of my camera <em>start</em> at a much higher level, so I&rsquo;m working with significantly better source imagery, which is candy for a designer.</p>

<p>Unlike my video work, I&rsquo;m able to create photos that I really like, which incentives me to shoot and post more. I created <a href="http://photos.danmall.me/">a little site where I&rsquo;ll be posting my photos</a>, and you can also follow me on my public Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danmallphotos/">@danmallphotos</a> dedicated to my photography journey. I&rsquo;m excited about doing a <a href="https://jeffbartlettmedia.com/workshops/canadian-rockies/">one-day workshop in the Canadian Rockies with Jeff Barlett</a> in a few weeks and am determined to take a few more trips like this throughout the year to practice photography even more.</p>

<h2>Sole man</h2>

<p>I added a few sneakers to the collection in 2019:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Nike Acronym x Air Presot Mid &ldquo;Multicolor&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 High FlyEase &ldquo;Black Toe&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG &ldquo;All Star &mdash; Chameleon&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 Mid SE GS &ldquo;Newspaper&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Nike SB Dunk High Pro (Parachute Beige/Ale Brown/Black)</li>
	<li>Air Jordan 1 Mid S (Black/Yellow)</li>
	<li>Nike Adapt BB Basketball Shoe (Black/White/Pure Platinum)</li>
	<li>Nike SF Air Force 1 Shoe (Muslin/University Red/Light Concord/Muslin)</li>
	<li>Nike SF Air Force 1 Boot (Dusty Peach/Dusty Peach)</li>
	<li>Nike SB Dunk High Pro (Black/Iguana/Baroque Brown/White)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Speaking</h2>

<p>I did 18 speaking-ish/teaching-ish things in 2019, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a > in Seattle, Boston, and Denver</li>
	<li><a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/event/owner-summit-2019">Owner Summit</a >, <a href="https://www.epicurrence.com/">Epicurrence</a>, <a href="https://artifactconf.com/">Artifact Conference</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/hangtimes/2019">Dribbble Hang Time</a>, <a href="http://www.asburyagile.com/">Asbury Agile</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/367846576">Smashing Conference</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> and I taught our <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/hot-potato-process/">designer + developer collaboration</a> workshop in Philly, Austin, and NYC</li>
	<li>I appeared in podcasts and videos with and for <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/interview-founder-of-superfriendly-dan-mall-talks-sharing-culture-our-myopic-tech-society.html">Awwwards</a> about tech, <a href="https://www.ninelabs.com/designdriven/episodes/dan-mall-superfriendly">Design Driven</a> about the product design process, <a href="https://www.ditchinghourly.com/episodes/pricing-design-with-guest-dan-mall">Ditching Hourly</a> about value pricing 7-figure design projects, and <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/webinar-a11y-and-design-systems/">Level Access</a> about the intersection between design systems and accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2020, I&rsquo;ll be at a few An Event Apart shows, the <a href="https://conference.awwwards.com/toronto/">Awwwards conference in Toronto</a>, and <a href="https://www.creativesouth.com/">Creative South</a>, talking and teaching about collaboration and design systems. If you&rsquo;re at any one of these events, please come say hello!</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>2019 was a big year for me in regards to SuperFriendly. We worked on so many cool things, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An enterprise design system for a major airline</li>
	<li><a href="https://khanacademyannualreport.org/">Khan Academy&rsquo;s 2018 annual report</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://artifactconf.com/">A site for the return of Artifact Conference</a></li>
	<li>Branding for <a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/">The Healthy</a>, Reader&rsquo;s Digest&rsquo;s foray into health</li>
	<li><a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/">On the Line</a>, an online resource from Toast to help restaurant owners</li>
	<li>A few other others that we can&rsquo;t talk about or are still cooking</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a lot of changes regarding the work I should be doing (and not doing) and roles that I should be playing (and not playing). I wrote a bit about that <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/">elsewhere</a> and will no doubt be sharing more in the near future as it unfolds. 2020 will be major for SuperFriendly.</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>

<ul>
	<li>My mom retired in 2019 after 43 years of being a nurse. Happy retirement, Mom!</li>
	<li>I was <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1209110785781325829">&ldquo;randomly&rdquo; selected for screening at airports</a> 5 times in 2019.</li>
	<li>I wrote 14 blog posts in 2019. That&rsquo;s up from 11 in 2018, 5 in 2017, 12 in 2016, and 11 in 2015.</li>
	<li>I&rsquo;ve collected loyalty and credit card points for years. In 2019, I started spending them, because I realized that I probably never would.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2020</h2>

<p>Part of what I love about writing a year in review is that there are things I don&rsquo;t realize until I look at them in aggregate. From writing this, I can see that I read more, wrote more, and learned more this year than I have in previous years. I&rsquo;m really excited about that because one of my goals for 2019 was to create some space for myself. I didn&rsquo;t know until writing this sentence, but mission accomplished.</p>                

<p>This year was a recharging year for me. I&rsquo;m ready to see what that does for me in 2020.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a heck of a year and a heck of a decade. Best wishes to you and yours, and here&rsquo;s to an amazing 2020!</p>

<p>Midway through 2019, we officially and publicly repositioned the company to focus solely on <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/glossary/#design-system">design systems</a>. An overwhelming majority of the work we were doing over the last few years was design systems work anyway, so we decided to be upfront about this focus in hopes that <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/oil-change-pizza/">the narrower positioning</a> would bring some advantages.</p>

<p>And boy, it did. The end of 2019 showed bore plenty of fruits of that labor. We&rsquo;ve seen a 1,000% increase in the amout of leads in our pipeline compared to what we had at this time last year.</p>

<p>In order to figure out how to set up well for a great 2020, I found it useful to look back at how SuperFriendly has done thus far. (I shared a more detailed version of this with the team and thought it could be helpful to share some of this publicly in case it helps any other agency owner out there.)</p>

<h2>Time spent</h2>

<p>At the end of 2012, I shared some data about <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/superfriendly-annual-report-2012/">how I spent my time</a> in year one as an owner of a new agency that was still primarily responsible for the majority of production work. Nowadays, at the close of year seven, I&rsquo;m much less involved. Here&rsquo;s a comparison of how 2019 compared to 2012. <sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></p>

<aside id="note1">
	<p>The percentages don&rsquo;t add up to 100%, mostly because I only wanted to show the most significant changes between 2012 and 2019.</p>
</aside>

<p>A few takeaways here for me:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Though I&rsquo;m still involved in project work a bit, my project time tends to be spent significantly more on direction than actual design and coding work. That said, we&rsquo;ve made some pretty major changes that will now further remove me from both direction and production work in 2020, so I&rsquo;ll be really curious to see how this graph changes over the next year.</li>
	<li>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Cameron Moll&rsquo;s <a href="https://medium.com/come-in-we-re-hiring/the-minimum-vacation-policy-15f6c3b922f">Minimum Vacation Policy</a> since he wrote about it, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to put it into effect more and more each year. My general premise was to pick 2 days at the beginning of each month that I was going to take off, not to do anything specific but really just to give myself a break and time to recharge. That didn&rsquo;t really go as planned, as I instead took longer breaks in big chunks, but I&rsquo;m still pleased to see that I averaged 28 days of vacation in 2019 which computes to a little more than 2 days per month.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Profit</h2>

<p>Our profit has really fluctuated over the years and is generally trending downwards. A major focus for 2020 is to at least level this out, if not trend upwards. A profit of 58% would do the trick, but it&rsquo;s a touch too ambitious to be realistic. We&rsquo;re shooting for 50%.</p>

<h2>Purpose-driven goals</h2>

<p>As I reflect on and continue to refine <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/purpose/">SuperFriendly&rsquo;s purpose</a>, I&rsquo;ve realized that a grand opportunity is to <strong>create better opportunities for creative people to flourish</strong>. Against that criteria, I think it&rsquo;s important to continually evaluate how many opportunities we&rsquo;re creating, for whom, and how good those opportunities are. A quick rundown:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2019, we worked with <strong><a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/thanks-2019-superfriends/">23 different SuperFriends</a></strong>.</li>
	<li>We paid those 23 SuperFriends a total of <strong>$325,000</strong> (an average of just over <strong>$14,000 each</strong>).</li>
	<li>Of the 23 SuperFriends, <strong>8 are women</strong> and <strong>15 are men</strong>.</li>
	<li>Of the 23 SuperFriends, <strong>6 are people of color</strong> and <strong>17 are white</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing a growth rate of around 20% <sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>, I&rsquo;ve set these goals for 2020: </p>

<aside id="note2">
	<p>In general, I tend to use 20% as standard benchmark, because I learned from Tim Kadlec&rsquo;s <a href="https://timkadlec.com/2014/01/fast-enough/">Fast Enough</a> that a 20% difference is when a change is noticeable</p>
</aside>

<ol>
	<li>Work with <strong>30 different SuperFriends</strong>.</li>
	<li>Pay all SuperFriends a total of <strong>$500,000</strong> (an average of just under <strong>$17,000 each</strong>).</li>
	<li>Of the 30 SuperFriends, let&rsquo;s work with <strong>at least 15 women</strong>.</li>
	<li>Of the 30 SuperFriends, let&rsquo;s work with <strong>at least 15 people of color</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Dividing each of those things by four gives us our 2020 Q1 <a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example">OKRs</a>.)</p>

<p>Honestly, those feel like really easy metrics to hit. I&rsquo;m hopeful that we&rsquo;ll reach those number much earlier than the end of the year and be able to set our sights on more ambitious things.</p>

<p>The big misconceptionI&rsquo;ve seen designers and developers often fall victim to is believing that handoff goes one way. Designers hand off comps to developers and think their work is done. That puts a lot of pressure on the designer to get everything perfect in one pass.</p>

<p>Instead, great collaboration follows what <a href="https://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> and I call &ldquo;The Hot Potato Process,&rdquo; where ideas are passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle. This is exactly what we&rsquo;re demonstrating in <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/designer-developer-workflow/">our designer + developer collaboration recording</a> and <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/designer-developer-collaboration-workshop/">what we teach in our collaboration workshops</a>.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/hot-potato-process/waterfall-vs-hotPotato.svg" alt="Waterfall vs. Hot Potato" />

<h2>Sit together</h2>

<p>It seems overly simplistic, but the best way for designers and developers to start trying The Hot Potato Process is to sit together. We&rsquo;ve seen many a designer + developer pair who have worked together for years become enlightened as to how the other works within the first few minutes of sitting together.</p>

<h2>Distributed teams</h2>

<p>The first piece of pushback we often get about The Hot Potato Process is that it seems ideal only for co-located teams. But, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/remote-workers-work-from-home.html">increasingly more people are working remotely</a>, good processes should adapt to all the different ways that people work; the Hot Potato Process is no exception to that.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t sit together in person, use video chat and other real-time synchronous tools to simulate working together in a co-located way. My teams will often <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1100082226346250240">leave a Zoom chat open for a few hours</a> as a proxy for being in the same office together, even if we&rsquo;re not talking to each other the whole time.</p>

<aside>
	<p>For more great tips on remote working, see Mandy Brown&rsquo;s excellent article, &ldquo;<a href="http://stet.editorially.com/articles/making-remote-teams-work/">Making remote teams work</a>.&rdquo;</p>
</aside>

<h2>Use recordings to bridge time zone gaps</h2>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t work at the same time due to time zones not lining up, you can record yourself working and send it to your collaborator. Your collaborator can then work alongside your recording while making their own recording. Then continue to pass recordings back and forth. Tools like <a href="https://www.voxer.com/">Voxer</a>, <a href="https://www.marcopolo.me/">Marco Polo</a>, and other walkie-talkie- and intercom-like apps help to make asynchronous collaboration feel a bit closer to synchronous collaboration.</p>

<h2>Working together means working together</h2>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t sit together in person or trade recordings or approximate these kinds of approaches, you might have to come to terms with the fact that you&rsquo;re not truly working together.</p>

			<uri>http://danmall.me/</uri>
		</author>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>When I was first learning design, the <a href="https://www.commarts.com/">Communication Arts</a> annuals were often my go-to resource for best-in-class inspiration. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be on the jury for the <a href="https://www.commarts.com/competition/2020-interactive">2020 Interactive Awards</a> along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gb2019/">Guillaume Braun</a> of <a href="https://www.akufen.ca/en">Akufen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jacinte">Jacinte Faria</a> of <a href="https://www.stinkstudios.com/">Stink Studios</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hayhughes">Hayley Hughes</a> of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philliptiongson/">Phillip Tiongson</a> of <a href="https://www.potiondesign.com/">Potion</a>.</p>

<p>Historically, the work awarded in this show and others like it has typically been apps, microsites, installations, and other short-lived pieces, tied to some advertising campaign or marketing push. This makes sense, as awards like this tend to be highly coveted by ad agencies and production shops as a way to somewhat objectively endorse work in an otherwise unregulated industry. In <a href="https://www.commarts.com/magazine/2019-interactive">last year&rsquo;s Interactive Annual</a>, 31 of the 37 awarded pieces were tied to a campaign of some sort.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a complaint. I&rsquo;ve always loved work like Tool of North America&rsquo;s <a href="http://toolofna.com/work/amazon-jurassic-box">Jurassic Box Experience</a>, and I hope we continue to see that kind of submission.</p>

<p>But I <em>do</em> hope to see some more work that typically goes unheralded. I&rsquo;d like to see more sites, not microsites. I&rsquo;d like to see apps that people use regularly, not apps that have a 6-week shelf life, where all that&rsquo;s left to reference it is a sizzle reel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic that this isn&rsquo;t outside of the spirit of this competition. While the Commarts Interactive competition has traditionally only featured jurors that work in advertising, recent years have seen more jurors from product companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/megangmeeker">Megan Meeker</a> of <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lbawcombe/">Libby Bawcombe</a> of <a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>. That&rsquo;s a noteworthy signal that product work can be as inspiring and exciting as advertising.</p>

<p>I love that last year&rsquo;s jury awarded sites like <a href="https://cowboy.com/">Cowboy</a> by <a ref="https://ueno.co/">Ueno</a>, <a href="https://thecoolclub.co/">The Cool Club</a > by <a href="https://wonderlandindustry.com/">Wonderland</a>, and <a href="https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/">Rapha</a> by <a href="https://work.co/">Work &amp; Co.</a> These are sites that command the same level of polish found in any good ad campaign but perform a <em>business</em> function for the company in addition to a marketing function. This is the kind of work I think we should celebrate more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to award work that demonstrates creative use of the highest level of color contrast ratios and works well on assistive devices. I&rsquo;d love to award work that&rsquo;s still useful when JavaScript fails. I&rsquo;d love to award work that shows smart thinking and strategy in addition to flawless execution and art direction. I&rsquo;d love to award work that serves business and user needs. I&rsquo;d love to award the <a ref="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358823008?mt=8">Flighty</a> app. I&rsquo;d love to award Gov.uk&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-ready-brexit-check">Get ready for Brexit</a> guide. I&rsquo;d love to award the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lyft/id529379082">flagship Lyft app</a> in addition to the <a href="https://www.deeplocal.com/lyft-auto-tunes">Lyft Auto Tunes</a> campaign. I&rsquo;d love to award <a href="https://design.theguardian.com/">The Guardian&rsquo;s guide to digital design</a>. I&rsquo;d love to award the <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a h> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> <em>platforms</em>, not solely their apps or sites.</p>

<p>But I can only award work that&rsquo;s submitted.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://www.commarts.com/competition/2020-interactive">please submit that kind of work</a>! If you do, you have my word that, as a jury member, I&rsquo;ll do my darnedest to lobby for why brilliant, often utilitarian, people-serving work deserves a spot on our award shelves.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my review of <cite>Avengers: Endgame</cite>. Warning: major spoilers included.</p>

<h2>Spoilers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying it again: spoilers included below. If you haven&rsquo;t seen <cite>Endgame</cite> yet and you&rsquo;re the kind of person that gets upset if they know things going into a movie, don&rsquo;t read any further. Spoilers included for not just <cite>Endgame</cite> but also <cite>Interstellar</cite>, <cite>Looper</cite>, <cite>Back to the Future</cite>, <cite>The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife</cite>, <cite>Ant-Man and the Wasp</cite>, <cite>Doctor Strange</cite>, <cite>Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse</cite>, and <cite>Infinity War</cite>. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p>As my buddies on <a href="https://twitter.com/comicbookjunto?lang=en">Comic Book Junto</a> say, 3&hellip; 2&hellip; 1&hellip; if you&rsquo;re reading past this point, it&rsquo;s your fault.</p>

<p>Here goes.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Overall, the movie was great. As the final chapter in an 11-year, 22-movie arc, the stakes couldn&rsquo;t have been higher. And <cite>Endgame</cite> delivered.</p>

<p>The amount of characters and storylines to incorporate was staggering. But what <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/whedon-ultron-nightmare/">Joss Whedon failed to do</a> in <cite>Age of Ultron</cite>, <cite>Endgame</cite> directors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus handled as well as could be imagined.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen it once so far and intend to many times over, but I doubt I&rsquo;ll much of my positive opinion will change upon subsequent viewings. There is one thing, though, that I take issue with: time travel.</p>


<h2>Time travel</h2>

<p>When we first sat down in the theater, <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyjanemall">Em</a> nonchalantly whispered to me, &ldquo;I bet they go back in time and everyone comes back to life.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I replied, &ldquo;Gosh, I hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Scott Lang goes on to tell everybody about the quantum realm and seals the deal with the phrase &ldquo;time heist,&rdquo; which makes me involuntary produce a simultaneous &ldquo;sigh &amp; eye-roll&rdquo; combo a suburban Philadelphia movie theater has ever seen.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t I like time travel? Two reasons: it&rsquo;s confusing and disrespectful.</p>

<h2>Time travel is confusing</h2>

<p>As soon as you open the &ldquo;time travel&rdquo; door, things get&hellip; science-y. Even if you don&rsquo;t know it specifically, time travel is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special relativity</a>, which quickly brings up questions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox">twin paradox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">grandfather paradox</a>, and the like.</p>

<p>So, it stands to reason that plots based around time travel bring up these questions. How do you solve this? In my opinion, the movies that solve this best are the ones <em>about</em> time travel directly. Time travel isn&rsquo;t just a plot device; it is <em>the</em> plot device.</p>

<ul>
	<li><cite>Back to the Future</cite> is a great example. To reduce confusion, it stuck with a single timeline where the events of the past can affect the future. I believe the simplicity of the story is why it remain our collective logical explanation of how time travel works, so much so that <cite>Endgame</cite> had to spend time trying to convince us <em>not</em> to consider this model.</li>
	<li><cite>The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife</cite> is all about the confusion that time travel creates.</li>
	<li><cite>Looper</cite> tackles the grandfather paradox head on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about movies that aren&rsquo;t <em>about</em> time travel that still involve it? <cite>Interstellar</cite> capitalizes on the fact that the simplest explanation for the twin paradox is wormholes, and since they&rsquo;re in space, this coincidentally fits. Like <cite>Back to the Future</cite>, the simplicity makes it a convincing enough explanation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> has even utilized this same technique. Janet van Dyne really shouldn&rsquo;t have aged in the quantum realm, but it would have been weirder for Hank and Hope (and the audience) if she didn&rsquo;t, so we went with it. In <cite>Infinity War</cite>, Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse a tiny bit of time to get the Mind Stone from Vision&rsquo;s head after Scarlet Witch destroys it&mdash;which is crazy confusing!&mdash;but we go with it because our suspension of disbelief just says that that&rsquo;s how the Time Stone works.</p>

<p>So, instead of making all of Act II a confusing time heist, there was another option available that&rsquo;s a bit more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&rsquo;s razor</a>-like: the multiverse. <cite>Doctor Strange</cite> introduced it, <cite>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</cite> (despite not officially being part of the <abbr>MCU</abbr>) gave us a great story with it at the core &hellip; heck, the Ancient One even reminded us of it. In my opinion, this could have also gotten us to an interesting place, perhaps even moreso than where the current plot left us. More on this later.</p>

<p>Even more significant than realizing that time travel is confusing, time travel is disrespectful to the audience.</p>

<h2>Time travel is disrespectful</h2>

<p>Few things make comic book fans groan as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity">retcons</a>. It&rsquo;s the ultimate case of &ldquo;that thing you thought happened didn&rsquo;t actually happen.&rdquo; The late 90s and early aughts were where many of us stopped reading comics, and I think it&rsquo;s no coincidence that that time was also rampant with retcons&mdash;from Spider-Man clones to the real story of Wolverine claws to teenage Iron Man and much more.</p>

<p>Time travel is a close second to retcons. While it&rsquo;s not exactly &ldquo;that thing you thought happened didn&rsquo;t actually happen,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a close &ldquo;that thing happened but we&rsquo;re gonna make it so it didn&rsquo;t.&ldquo;</p>

<p>One of the reasons <cite>Infinity War</cite> was so great was because of the the impact of The Decimation, more commonly known as &ldquo;the snap.&rdquo; Thanos erases half the population of the entire universe, and that&rsquo;s how the movie ends?! What drama! It left viewers reeling, myself included, just plain shocked and in disbelief that any movie&mdash;much less part 1 of the end of this phase of the <abbr>MCU</abbr>&mdash;could end like that.</p>

<p>Time travel reverses that impact. It spits in its face. It makes it an easy undo, a joke. It says, &ldquo;You know that emotion you felt? It wasn&rsquo;t worth having.&rdquo; I love how writer Brett Riley puts it in his article, &ldquo;<a href="http://officialbrettriley.com/2018/02/05/no-more-retcons-and-reboots-rules-for-a-good-comics-universe/">No More Retcons and Reboots: Rules for a Good Comics Universe</a>&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>There were never any stakes&hellip; Nothing was sacred&hellip; If a story touched you, you had best forget it, because the companies sure would&hellip; Why do I want to read stories today that will be meaningless tomorrow? Why do I want to read about characters who might be replaced, killed for a few months, resurrected, killed again, changed beyond recognition only to be changed back again, <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, <i lang="la">ad nauseum</i>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, <cite>Endgame</cite>&rsquo;s time travel story undid a lot of the admiration I had for the boldness of <cite>Infinity War</cite>.</p>


<h2>If not time travel, then what else? <a class="dm-dp-anchorLink">#</a></h2>

<p>When I heard this was the last chapter in this phase of the <abbr>MCU</abbr>, I was hoping that meant everything new. New characters, new storylines, new everything. Then I saw the <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/04/13/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-4-movies-list/">phase 4 movie list</a>:</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/avengers-endgame/phase4.png" alt="The MCU Phase 4 movie list" />

<p>While these are exciting movies with some new characters, there are also some old ones too. The conceivable return of Black Widow, Thor, Black Panther, Guardians, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man doesn&rsquo;t exactly feel new; it still seems like a continuation.</p>

<p>I like when things end on a high note. Despite my nitpicky time travel quibble, <cite>Endgame</cite> was a high note. We saw characters like Iron Man way more than characters like Vision, and that&rsquo;s ok; we can still end it there. I think that&rsquo;d be a lot more fitting than getting sick of Scott Lang because there&rsquo;s two more movies with him in it. I&rsquo;d rather leave wanting more of these stories than feeling like it was too much. Let&rsquo;s close this book and move on to a new one. The idea of a multiverse could give us that.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s leave these characters in this universe. They beat Thanos. All the snapped are (regrettably) unsnapped and back. Good on them. The end.</p>

<p>And let&rsquo;s turn our attention to a different universe for the next decade. One where Kamala Khan is Ms. Marvel instead of Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel. One where Miles Morales is Spider-Man instead of Peter Parker. Even though we saw a graceful transition from a Steve Rogers Captain America to a Sam Wilson Captain America, the multiverse gives us a pass to not need a graceful transition. New place, new stories. &rsquo;Nuff said. </p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my little &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; exercise into what <cite>Endgame</cite> could have been. Over a decade with these characters has been more than enjoyable. It&rsquo;s allowed and inspired us to dream up even more new stories, and that&rsquo;s the real success of the <abbr>MCU</abbr>.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really been happy about the way I&rsquo;ve worked with typography in design systems before. As I&rsquo;m currently working on another big design system, it seemed time to change that.</p>

<p>Common wisdom regarding typography in design systems seems to often include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>T-shirt sizing (small, medium, large, etc.)</li>
	<li>Some context-specific dichotomy like &ldquo;heading sizes&rdquo; or &ldquo;body sizes&rdquo; or &ldquo;caption style&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Some sort of <a href="http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/">typographic scale</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s deconstruct these a bit. </p>

<p>On the surface, t-shirt sizes make good sense. They follow a metaphor that just about all people can understand intuitively. But there are a few areas where I&rsquo;ve seen them break down, especially when tied to a context like headings or body text:</p>

<p>First, they don&rsquo;t scale well. Many systems need a few more options than the typical six: <abbr title="Extra Small">XS</abbr>, <abbr title="Small">S</abbr>, <abbr title="Medium">M</abbr>, <abbr title="Large">L</abbr>, <abbr title="Extra Large">XL</abbr>, <abbr title="Extra extra large">XXL</abbr>. Because of that, I&rsquo;ve encountered too many systems that try to hack it with a &ldquo;Medium-2&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mini Large&rdquo; or &ldquo;<abbr title="Extra extra extra extra extra large">XXXXXL</abbr>&rdquo; in them, all additions that break the simplicity and intuitiveness of t-shirt size system. I&rsquo;m counting the days until I find a &ldquo;Schmedium" style somewhere.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s too easy to conflate the <code>h4</code> style&mdash;intended to be shorthand for &ldquo;the fourth largest heading style&rdquo;&mdash;into actually meaning &ldquo;use an <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> element.&rdquo; After all, <code>&lt;h2 class="h4"&gt;</code>is a bit of a mindbender and seems wrong at first glance. I&rsquo;ve seen those who don&rsquo;t understand the power of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s designers that aren&rsquo;t very familiar with front-end code or <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/full-stack-developers/">full-stack developers who focus more or back-end or DevOps than front-end</a>&mdash;feel forced to choose between appropriate styling and semantic code. They&rsquo;ll pick an inappropriate element because it looks visually looks right or pick what visually looks right at the expense of semantics and accessibility, defeating the inherent advantages that <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> have out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>Seeing where this kind of system becomes difficult has taught me a few things:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Linear systems work well when we can accurately predict how they&rsquo;ll scale, and we humans suck at predicting how others will use the systems we create.</strong> If you call a 12px text size &ldquo;small&rdquo; and a 16px text size &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; you better be dang sure no one will ever need a 14px text size, or you can kiss your system goodbye.</li>
	<li><strong>Abstracting styles are difficult but worthwhile.</strong> Calling it a &ldquo;caption style&rdquo; means it&rsquo;ll likely never get used in the utility navigation, even if it&rsquo;s the right style. This leads to a lot of duplication in <abbr>CSS</abbr>.</li>
	<li><strong>In a system designed to be used frequently, intuitiveness may be over-valued.</strong> It might be just fine to ask people to learn a system that has a slight learning curve. Habit may very well be the solution to the difficulty that is creating an intuitive system.</li>
</ol>

<p>With those in mind, here are some other ways I explored to create a typographic system that works.</p>




<h2>Guessability, an alternative to intuitiveness <a href="#guessability">#</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_JanSH_1a1_w?node=18379216011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-1&amp;pf_rd_r=KXMR7XYNJE17P9D30QDN&amp;pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=f674e2d6-ee8c-4e74-b263-44e37c320640&amp;pf_rd_i=6563140011">Amazon Echo</a> was the first voice-controlled personal assistant I purchased. The thing that most impressed me was how well it catered to things I <em>guessed</em> I could do with it, even if I didn&rsquo;t <em>know</em> I could.</p>

<p>Coming to terms with the fact that there likely isn&rsquo;t a wholly intuitive typographic system I could employ and that there likely will be <em>some</em> sort of learning curve actually gives me a bit of leeway. I started to think about systems that could have high guessability.</p>

<p>I explored what kind of guessability I could achieve when drawing upon institutional knowledge, popular knowledge, and common knowledge.</p>




<h3 id="institutional-knowledge">Institutional knowledge <a href="#institutional-knowledge">#</a></h3>

<p>Ever since I stumbled across Andy Clarke&rsquo;s <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/star-wars-styling">Star Wars styling</a>, I&rsquo;ve wanted to try something similar. One of the design systems we&rsquo;re building right now is for a major airline, so my first thought was to tie the typographic system back to a piece of institutional knowledge: in this case, the fleet. Even if designers and developers aren&rsquo;t already familiar, this could be a nice way to get some engrained knowledge about the company&rsquo;s main offerings. Here&rsquo;s the first pass at that.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/fleet.png" alt="Tying typography styles to an airline fleet" />

<p>One of the biggest problems with this is that not only is it <em>not</em> intuitive, but it&rsquo;s actually counterintuitive, essentially unguessable. I do a fair bit of flying on planes, but I learned during this exercise that a 747 is larger than a 777 and a 757 is longer than a 767. And, once I run out of 700-level planes, I have to move to a completely different type of plane&mdash;the smaller CRJ line&mdash;all of which I imagine to be incredibly infuriating for a designer or developer that&rsquo;s just trying to set a 32-px headline. This is a non-starter.</p>





<h3 id="popular-knowledge">Popular knowledge <a href="#popular-knowledge">#</a></h3>

<p>Since institutional knowledge tended to have too much nuance to be helpful, I decided to try out more popular knowledge. The Brady Bunch and Simpsons characters have inherent age groups and sizes that may map to any typographic scale nicely:</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/brady-bunch.png" alt="Tying typography styles to the Brady Bunch kids" />

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/simpsons.png" alt="Tying typography styles to Simpsons characters" />

<p>While there&rsquo;s some merit here, there are definitely problems as well:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a designer isn&rsquo;t familiar with the Brady Bunch or the Simpsons, the system is completely useless, because it&rsquo;s unguessable.</li>
	<li>There are scale problems here too. The Brady Bunch system features the 6 kids. But what happens if we need a 7th style? Add Alice? And shouldn&rsquo;t the Alice style be larger than the Greg style? We&rsquo;s back in t-shirt size territory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Popular knowledge also seems to have just as many disadvantages as advantages.</p>




<h3 id="common-knowledge">Common knowledge <a href="#common-knowledge">#</a></h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer that <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">design systems should contain the smallest number of elements that help you design the greatest variety of interfaces</a>. So, I set out to create the smallest number of unique typographic styles that any interface in this system might need. Starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">magical number seven, plus or minus two</a>, I challenged myself to create 7 and only 7 typographic styles. I think of them as &ldquo;presets,&rdquo; a default combination that acts as a starter to be modified.</p>

<p>I also tried not to be too clever about the names. There are 7 presets, named 1 through 7. The common knowledge here is that anyone that knows how to count gets this system. These are the atomic typographic units from which all the system&rsquo;s typography stems.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/presets.png" alt="Typography presets" />

<p>In <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/"><abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> style</a>, each of these presets also has a bold modifier.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/typography-in-design-systems/presets-bold.png" alt="Typography presets bold modifier" />

<p>If we try as much as possible to stick with these 7 options but decide we really need another typographic style, it&rsquo;s easy enough to tack it onto the end as number 8. No need to try to sneak anything in-between the existing presets. The guessability is extremely high here.</p>

<h2>A typographic system in code <a href="#type-in-code">#</a></h2>

<p>To actually use this typographic system in a digital product, let&rsquo;s set up some canonical presets as mixins to be included everywhere. Each preset includes the combination of properties&mdash;size, leading, weight&hellip; whatever you decide&mdash;that should always travel with it. Here&rsquo;s how that might look in an <code>.scss</code> file <sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<aside id="note1">

	<p>I&rsquo;m glossing over a few details of how I set up my <abbr>CSS</abbr> files philosophically, which I&rsquo;ve described in a previous article, &ldquo;<a href="http://danmall.me/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">Cooking with Design Systems</a>.&rdquo;</p>

</aside>

<pre><code class="language-scss">
@mixin text-preset-1 {
    font-size: 40px;
    font-weight: 300;    
    line-height: 56px;
}

@mixin text-preset-7 {
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: 300;    
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    line-height: 20px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
</code></pre>

<p>These are the only places in your <abbr>(S)CSS</abbr> that you should see <code>font-size</code> or <code>line-height</code> or <code>font-weight</code> declarations. Everywhere else in your code, you should be simply including 1 of these 7 presets:</p>

<pre><code class="language-scss">
.caption {
    @include text-preset-7;
}

.tabs_title {
    @include text-preset-7;
}

.kicker {
    @include text-preset-7;
}

@mixin text-preset-7--bold {
    @include text-preset-7;
    font-weight: 700;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do find individual declarations, they should be a sign to you that you&rsquo;re intentionally overriding or deviating from the system.</p>

<p>This methodology can help you tie different elements to the same canonical typographic preset. This way, any broad changes happen at the preset level and can trickle outward to any component that inherits that style.</p>



<h2>So far, so good <a href="#so-far-so-good">#</a></h2>

<p>To date, we&rsquo;ve built about 45 <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/design-systems-pilots-scorecards/">pilots</a> utilizing over 80 <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">atoms, molecules, and organisms</a>, and the typographic system of 7 presets has held up without having to have added to it. That&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t have outliers, but so far, I only count twice that we&rsquo;ve had to make something custom.</p>

<p>What kinds of typographic systems have you found useful?</p>

<p>I started wearing glasses in 1995, and I switched to contacts in 1999. Two days ago&mdash;twenty years later&mdash;I got laser eye surgery. Here&rsquo;s the play-by-play.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/">2018 Year in Review</a>, I mentioned wanting to investigate being done with glasses and contacts for good. So a month ago, I quickly Google-search for the closest laser eye surgery place<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> and go in for a consultation. After a brief eye exam, they tell me that my -2.5 left eye prescription and -3.25 right eye prescription make me eligible for the procedure.</p>

<aside id="note1">

	<p>This article is more about my experience than it is a review of the LASIK office I got the surgery done. If you&rsquo;re curious about how I picked, it was mostly based on a combination what was close by and reading great reviews on Google and Facebook.</p>

</aside>

<p>Eyes naturally change over time, so apparently about 5% of patients need an enhancement after a few years. They give me two different prices: $3,902 for the surgery with a lifetime plan that covers enhancements for life and $2,611 that only covers enhancements for 2 years after the initial surgery. They also offer a $200 incentive on each plan if I do the procedure before the end of the month.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough time to do the procedure and recover before some upcoming travel, so I put it off a few weeks, which gives me some additional time to think about it. <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">Knowing a little bit about how people set prices</a>, the $200 incentive clues me in to the possibility that they might need the business more than I want to have unassisted perfect vision. A month later, I call back to schedule the procedure, and I tell them that I&rsquo;d love to do the lifetime plan but that I don&rsquo;t really want to spend more than $3,000 on this.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> After a brief hold, they say that, in addition to the original $200 discount they offered, they can do an additional $500 off for local customers, bringing the total to $3,202. I accept their clearly-fabricated but still-gracious additional discount and pick a date for the procedure.</p>

<aside id="note2">
	<p>They offered financing too, but I&rsquo;m generally not a fan of that. I&rsquo;m not very disciplined when it comes to using credit, so I&rsquo;ll often choose to wait until I have the money to pay for what I want in full.</p>
</aside>

<h2>Surgery time <a href="#surgery-time">#</a></h2>

<p>They call in a few eye drop prescriptions to my pharmacy and tell me not to wear contacts for at least 3 days before the procedure. Eye drops in bag and glasses on my face, Em and the kids ride with me to the LASIK office. I arrive around 1:30<abbr title="Post Meridien">PM</abbr>. I fill out some paperwork, pay, and schedule a follow up appointment for the next day. I ask if I&rsquo;ll be able to drive myself, to which they answer a resounding, &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sit for about an hour, then the doctor calls me in. He says, &ldquo;Time to take your glasses off for the last time&rdquo;&mdash;a bit melodramatic but I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it&mdash;and administers a few numbing drops.</p>

<p>While waiting for the drops to take effect, he asks me about my left eyelid, which droops down a little lower than my right. He asks me if it had always been that way, which I confirm. He mentions it won&rsquo;t be a problem at all, but that if it affects my vision in the future, I might want to get it lifted. I silently acquiesce, as he&rsquo;s not the first doctor to mention that to me.</p>

<p>He leads me into the operating room. An assistant asks me to lie down, and she administers more numbing drops (which I&rsquo;ve read apparently reduces your urge to blink). I&rsquo;m not positive of what happens after that since I don&rsquo;t actually see it myself, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what it feels like. <sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></p>

<aside id="note3">
	<p>I confirmed a lot of what I thought was happening with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDWaKpk8Ygs">Louis Cole&rsquo;s laser eye surgery vlog</a>. Don&rsquo;t watch if you&rsquo;re squeamish.</p>
</aside>
	
<p>The assistant tapes my right eyelids open. The doctor applies some tool that locked the eyelids into place; I feel a little pressure on my right eye but it&rsquo;s ever-so slight. The doctor swivels a machine on top of my right eye, and I stare up at a red dot. I have both eyes open, and the doctor says, &ldquo;Your right eye is going to go dark,&rdquo; and suddenly, it does. This is the part where they peel back my cornea to get ready to do the correction <sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>, but I don&rsquo;t feel anything here.</p>

<aside id="note4">
	<p>If you want to know how laser eye surgery actually works, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/visionsurgery/lasik.htm">a complete guide</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>The same happens with my left eye; again, I don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>

<p>The assistant asks me to get up slowly as she holds my hand. My vision is blurry. She slowly leads me to another station 3 feet away and asks me to lie down again.</p>

<p>The doctor swivels a new machine over my right eye. I remember less about the details of this one. I look up and see red lights in a cross-stitch pattern surrounded by green lights in the same pattern. I assume this is the laser that&rsquo;s going to do the correction. The doctor seems to have a tool and the best way I can describe it was like he&rsquo;s &ldquo;fishing around&rdquo; in my right eye. I don&rsquo;t feel this&hellip; more like I could see it, albeit blurry. Next, the laser seems to be doing something, and I smell a slight burning (I previously read about this, so I expected it). Doctor comes back with his fishing-around tool and then says the right eye is done. That wasn&rsquo;t so bad at all!</p>

<p>Next up: left eye. Doctor fishes around again, but this time, I feel it a bit. It feels like something grazing my eye. Laser does it&rsquo;s thing, then Doctor says something to Assistant&mdash;I can&rsquo;t quite make it out, but I think I hear the word &ldquo;scratch,&rdquo; which worries me a bit&mdash;then Doctor fishes around again. But rather than being done now like the right eye was, the laser goes for another round. That worries me too, because that&rsquo;s not what happened with the right eye. Doctor comes back to fish around, and tells me the left eye is done.</p>

<p>Doctor and Assistant help me slowly stand up, and Doctor says, &ldquo;You did a great job.&rdquo; This worries me even more, because he sounds like he&rsquo;s trying to convince himself as much as me.</p>

<p>I ask, &ldquo;Did everything go ok?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor replies, &ldquo;Oh yes, everything&rsquo;s great. Go home and take a nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My vision is blurry at this point. I grab my stuff, throw some sunglasses on, and am escorted out to my car.</p>


<h2>The drive home <a href="#the-drive-home">#</a></h2>

<p>Em drives me home. I&rsquo;m reclined in the passenger seat, and the kids are in the backseat.</p>

<p>I have my eyes closed, and I think the numbing drops are wearing off. Tears start to stream down my face, uncontrollably. I&rsquo;m not crying; at least I don&rsquo;t think so, but it feels like it, both physically and emotionally. <strong>IT. BURNS.</strong> My nose is running. When I keep my eyes closed, it burns. When I try to open my eyes, tears flood down my face. I can&rsquo;t keep them open for long anyway, so I close them again, which burns, so I want to open them. The cycle continues.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to rub or even touch my eyes&mdash;ever, apparently&mdash;so my beard and top of my shirt are getting damp from my tears. I try to fall asleep, but it burns too much. I fall asleep a few minutes before we pull into the driveway.</p>

<p>Em helps me out of the car. My eyes closed, she leads me into our room, where I settle into bed around 4<abbr>PM</abbr>.</p>



<h2>Naptime <a href="#naptime">#</a></h2>

<p>Official instructions are to nap for 3 &ndash; 6 hours after the procedure, because there&rsquo;s really nothing else you could do anyway. The night before, I stayed up late the night and woke up early so I&rsquo;d be tired enough to nap. The LASIK office recommended Tylenol PM&mdash;or Valium&rdquo;but I&rsquo;m usually a good sleeper, so I decide to go cold turkey.</p>

<p>Em helps me carefully tape sleep shields on my eyes so I wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally rub my eyes in my sleep. She put a glass of water on my nightstand and leaves me so I can try to get some rest. I start listening to a boring finance audiobook. Unfortunately, my eyes are still burning, which is keeping me awake. Also, the boring finance audiobook&mdash;<cite><a href="https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book/">Your Money or Your Life</a></cite>&mdash;turns out to be really interesting, so I&rsquo;m actually paying attention instead of zoning out.</p>

<p>After what seems like an hour, I switch to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8Uebhn9wzrS?si=ztcBX52uQUSj6euJI4_t2Q">Chill Lofi Study Beats Spotify playlist</a> on low volume and finally start to doze off.</p>

<p>I wake up every 30 minutes or so. My eyes are still burning. I try to open my eyes, and tears flood out. I close them again and fall back asleep.</p>


<h2>After nap <a href="#after-nap">#</a></h2>

<p>I wake up more fully about two-and-a-half hours later at 6:30<abbr>PM</abbr>, mostly because I&rsquo;m hungry. Eyes still burning, I open them; tears still flood out, but seems like less tears than before. I force myself to keep my eyes open as long as I can before shutting them again. I sit in the dark for about half-an-hour, training myself to open and close my eyes as normally as possible.</p>

<p>I start the recommended eye drop routine: a steroid eyedrop and an antibiotic one every 2 hours. I eventually feel stable enough to throw some sunglasses on and venture out into the kitchen. Em and the kids have kindly turned of most of the lights in the house, and they&rsquo;re hanging out in the basement so I&rsquo;d have a quiet upstairs all to myself. I look slowly toward a light, then stop myself, as my eyes seem too sensitive for that. I warm up a bowl of leftover pasta and eat it in the dark dining room, mostly to get used to being awake. My vision seems clear, but I do see some spots and too much light doesn&rsquo;t feel great. My eyes still sting, especially my left eye, which feels scratched (though I can&rsquo;t tell if that&rsquo;s just the power of suggestion from my worries about the procedure).</p>

<p>Em and the kids come upstairs to read stories, pray, and get to bed. I say goodnight to the kids, and hang out in bed with Em. We talk for a while, mostly about my surprisingly interesting finance book. An hour or two of engaging conversation later, I realize I haven&rsquo;t thought about my eyes once, and that, now that I am thinking about them, they don&rsquo;t sting as much. One of a many benefits to having a riveting wife.</p>

<p>Even though the pain is decreasing, I still can&rsquo;t really look at light without wincing. I can&rsquo;t fathom how I&rsquo;m supposed to drive myself to a follow-up appt just 12 hours from now. I do my final round of eye drops for the night, tape my sleep shields on, and get ready for bed. I took a nap just a few hours ago, but I&rsquo;m still tired from the tenseness of it all, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to sleep.</p>




<h2>The next morning <a href="#the-next-morning">#</a></h2>

<p>I intentionally wake up at 5:30<abbr title="Ante Meridien">AM</abbr> (just about my usual waketime) because I want a few hours to get acclimated before having to drive to a 9<abbr>AM</abbr> follow-up appointment. My vision is blurry, but largely because I still have the sleep shields on. I walk to the bathroom, take off the sleep shields, and look around. <strong>Things are pretty clear.</strong> Also, almost no pain at all. Wow.</p>

<p>I turn the light on but brace myself. No light sensitivity.</p>

<p>I walk around the house. Life looks pretty good.</p>

<p>My care instructions say I should wear sunglasses indoors for a week, not because of light sensitivity, but as protection for my eyes so they don&rsquo;t accidentally get bummed or so I don&rsquo;t unintentionally rub them. I pop on sunglasses, marveling at the obvious difference from feeling so rough the night before and so good now.</p>

<p>I drive myself to my follow-up appointment with no issues. They test my eyesight: <strong>20/15 in each eye, 20/20 together,</strong> just 18 hours after the procedure.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re seriously living in the future.</p>



<h2>Two days in <a href="#two-days-in">#</a></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post on two day after the procedure. I&rsquo;m following the eye drops routine pretty religiously, as I&rsquo;ve read that sticking to that increases the speed of recovery significantly. If my eyes itch, I&rsquo;m supposed to use artificial tears, as itchiness is a symptom of dryness. The LASIK office suggested that I use artifical tears as often as I want, so I&rsquo;m making liberal use of that. The worst of it is that my left eye still feels <em>slightly</em> sandy every few hours, kinda like I have a dirty contact lens in. But, it goes away immediately when I use the eyedrops.</p>

<p>I switched to sleeping in ski goggles last night instead of sleep shields, as it&rsquo;s a little more comfortable and still keeps me from accidentally rubbing my eyes. And my co-workers seem to be fine with me joining calls with video either turned off or turn on while I&rsquo;m wearing sunglasses.</p>


<h2>Life changing <a href="#life-changing">#</a></h2>

<p>The biggest thing I heard from people who&rsquo;ve had this done previously is that it was life-changing to be able to wake up and immediately see clearly. I didn&rsquo;t really experience that this morning, partly because I&rsquo;ve heard it so much that I think it got overhyped and partly because I&rsquo;ve fallen asleep with contacts enough times to have experienced and remembered waking up with perfect vision.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s been more impactful for me so far is where I realize my previous habits and aren&rsquo;t necessary anymore. I don&rsquo;t have to take my contacts out before bed. I don&rsquo;t have to pack 2 weeks&rsquo; worth of extra contacts in a suitcase when I travel just in case I get stuck somewhere. I don&rsquo;t have to constantly carry around microfiber cloths to wipe dirty glasses. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting a contact knocked in my weekly basketball game. These are tiny things, but I think they&rsquo;re what I&rsquo;ll enjoy most.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>When <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">value pricing</a>&mdash;pricing work based on the value it brings your customer&mdash;here&rsquo;s a question I typically ask:</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;At what point does this project pay for itself?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Great answers I&rsquo;ve heard:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When 100 more students enroll.</li>
	<li>When we get an average of 5 more leads a month.</li>
	<li>When we add 1,000 more people to or mailing list.</li>
	<li>When people prefer us over our top competitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Answers I&rsquo;ve heard that make me think they&rsquo;re not ready for a project (at least not with <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>):</p>

<ul>
	<li>I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
	<li>Why is that any of your business?</li>
	<li>There&rsquo;s no way we can quantify that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart clients know what change they&rsquo;re looking for, even if they don&rsquo;t know how to achieve it. (That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re hiring help.) Sometimes I&rsquo;ll try to help them <em>articulate</em> the value, but I don&rsquo;t try to <em>define</em> it for them. That&rsquo;s like going to a mechanic, and then deciding which part of your car you want to fix.</p> 

<p>In my experience, clients that don&rsquo;t initially know what they want turn into clients that stretch out rounds of review and aren&rsquo;t happy with the final result. Even when we&rsquo;ve delivered something that might work for them, they can&rsquo;t tell, because they don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is.</p>

<p>But clients that know what they want from the start? They know <em>way</em> early on if we&rsquo;re on track or off course, because they know the destination.</p> 

<p>A client that knows what they want knows where the project pays for itself, where it breaks even. And that&rsquo;s the first price ceiling. If they have a $5,000 budget and expect 1000 more signups, they&rsquo;ll think they overpaid if you try to charge them $10,000 and they get 1,000 more signups (whether or not that&rsquo;s accurate).</p>

<p>But what if you&rsquo;re confident than you could get them 2,000 signups? Then you may be able to charge $10,000 because you&rsquo;re delivering twice the results they&rsquo;re expecting. Here&rsquo;s the kicker: that&rsquo;s still a break-even price, even though it&rsquo;s double their stated budget.</p>

<p><strong>You can confidently price over any stated budget if you can demonstrate that you will deliver more value than their break-even metric.</strong> The more you understand the break-even point, the more liberty you have to assess and communicate the multiples of value you can deliver.</p>

<p>When you value price, every price you give a client should be at least a break-even price. Better yet, every price you give a client should be a &ldquo;they got a deal&rdquo; price.</p>

<p><a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad</a> and I hosted our first public <a href="https://designdevjan2019.splashthat.com/">designer + developer collaboration workshop</a> yesterday. After sleeping on it, I declare it a resounding success!</p>              

                <p>We&rsquo;ve done this type of workshop before with our clients, but this was the first time we&rsquo;ve hosted it publicly. Many thanks to our friends at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com">InVision</a> for producing it so flawlessly.</p>

<p>Designer Zack Aronson asks an interesting question:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/danmall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@danmall</a> Watched the first 3 InVision Design System videos, thanks for doing those, been truly insightful. Any tool advice for a small design team (3 people) to get started on a design system? Sketch templates? Code templates?</p>&mdash; Zack Aronson (@ZackAronson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackAronson/status/1082006920138055680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://publication.design.systems/">great articles about design systems</a>, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve seen much written about how to start one.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> works with clients to create design systems, the first thing we&rsquo;ll do is an audit of the existing digital landscape. Do you have a public-facing website? A native mobile app? Some microsites? An intranet? </p>

<p>Of all of those, what are some interface elements that all of them have? Some common answers tend to include:</p>

<ul><li>Navigation
</li><li>Buttons
</li><li>Headings
</li><li>Lists
</li><li>Paragraphs
</li><li>Forms
</li><li>Tables
</li></ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to add everything that you think <em>might</em> go in a design system or <em>should</em> go into a design system, but try to resist that urge for now. Only include the components that <em>already</em> exist in all of the sites and apps. A good design system should be <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html#solvedproblemsandsettledscience">a collection of your organization&rsquo;s best institutional knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use buttons a lot in those products, don&rsquo;t include them! Front-end designer <a href="bradfrost.com">Brad Frost</a> is fond of saying, &ldquo;A design system is the story of how your organization makes products.&rdquo; If your products don&rsquo;t have lots of buttons in them, including buttons as a prominent element tells the wrong story about what you do and make. This focus is key to making sure your design system remains <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/distinct-design-systems/">distinct</a>.</p>

<p>Zack: if I were advising your 3-person design team, I&rsquo;d suggest that each of you pick a component that&rsquo;s already used frequently in your products. Looking at <a href="https://www.echo.com/">your site</a>, those 3 components might be:</p>

<ol><li>Navigation
</li><li>Primary Heading
</li><li>Footer
</li></ol>

<p>Pick the best version of each of these. That might be the footer from an intranet and a navigation and footer from main website. And &ldquo;best&rdquo; might mean from a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> design perspective, or that the markup is top-notch, or that it&rsquo;s built modularly&hellip; you decide.</p>

<p>Next step: put those 3 components somewhere. That could be a custom website you build, like <a href="https://material.io">Material Design</a> or <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com">Polaris</a>. But it could also be a wiki somewhere within your firewall. Or a Github repository. The important thing is that it contains: </p>

<ul><li>At least some front-end code you need to implement this component (because <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system/">a Sketch library is not a design system</a>)
</li><li>Some guidelines on how (and how not) to use this component
</li><li>A <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> that you can send to someone
</li></ul>

<p>Congratulations on launching <code>v1</code> of your design system! That&rsquo;s right: <code>v1</code> of a design system can just be 3 components. Heck, it can be only 1 component! If that 1 component saves you some time on your next project and makes everything that much more consistent from both a design and code standpoint, you&rsquo;re experiencing the full benefits of a design system.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think</span> I was one for year-end round-ups, but reading <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/12/twenty-eighteen/">Dave Rupert</a>&rsquo;s made me want to do one of my own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m generally a &ldquo;glass half full&rdquo; kind-of-guy, so while 2018 had both ups and downs, it was a pretty good year overall. In no particular order, some observations about my year and what I&rsquo;m looking forward to for 2019. </p>

<h2>Ten</h2>

<p><a href="http://emilymall.me/">Em</a> and I celebrated our ten-year wedding anniversary in 2018! We wanted to do a big celebration bash, but alas: we&rsquo;re both pretty terrible at follow-through for this kind of thing, so it never happened. We&rsquo;ve hired some help this time around, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll celebrate our 11th anniversary in 2019 with the Ma11 Ba11 (I know, I know&hellip; my logo designer is showing).</p>

<h2>Kids</h2>

<p>Parenting 2 daughters is more fun than it&rsquo;s ever been. I&rsquo;ll admit: as much as I tried to be a present and active dad, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to have fun and play with them as babies. That was really difficult for me. Now that they&rsquo;re older, I love so many more of the things we can do together! We've been playing a lot of board games like Clue, Battleship, and Taboo. </p>

<p>Sidda reads books and comics in her bed as a way to fall asleep every night. (She&rsquo;s currently into the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SAUsMI">Raina Telgemeier</a> series.)  She started ice skating lessons too and is loving that. We're talking about taking a trip together soon, just the two of us.</p>

<p>Charlie&rsquo;s asked me to give her piano lessons and practices on her own without prompting. She's frustrated that she can&rsquo;t read like big sis, which I think is the exact motivation that&rsquo;s going to get her to read. She draws letters constantly. </p>

<p>They both learned to swim this summer; Sidda&rsquo;s pretty fearless in the water now, while Char is still a bit hesitant. I bet one more summer of swimming will build that full confidence.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re also in the same school again after a year of being in different schools. It's a little weird as Seventh-day Adventists to have them in a Catholic school, but the school is great and it gives us the opportunity to talk about things like confirmation and baptism and whether or not they want to take part, which we leave up to them. It's also interesting to see them figure out how their relationship as sisters compares to their relationship to their friends.</p>

<p>Also, I think they both have boyfriends now.</p>

<p><img src="http://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/raven.gif" alt="Dread" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to more adventures with them in 2019.</p>

<h2>Taking care of my body</h2>

<p>I did some better things for my mind and body this past year. </p>

<p>I love soda and I really don&rsquo;t like drinking water. That&rsquo;s not a great combo, so I changed some of that around in 2018. First, I realized that I much prefer cold water to room temp, so I got a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-flex/color,lava,a,92,o,54">HydroFlask bottle</a> that&rsquo;s always filled with ice water. I also realized that some flavor in my water goes a long way, so my bottle is always filled with lemon, lime, oranges, strawberries, mint, cantaloupe, watermelon, or some combination of those. Those factors increased my water intake from virtually none to some. I also think that means that I drink soda less, but that might just be an unsubstantiated feeling. I quit soda in 2013 for about a year but am back on the sauce; perhaps 2019 is the year I quit again, or at least reduce my soda intake some.</p>

<p>I played basketball just about every Monday night. It&rsquo;s a competitively friendly full court run for 2 hours. Looking forward to continuing that again in 2019.</p>

<p>I also made more of a concerted effort to lift or do some form of calisthenics a few times a week. I'm less regular during busy work weeks, but I was going at least once or twice a week for a good stretch. Rather than do an intense program, <a href="https://twitter.com/octaviusanewman">Octavius Newman</a> turned me on to Jim Wendler&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lift.net/workout-routines/wendler-5-3-1/">5/3/1 workout</a>, which is more about a slow and methodical way to build strength over a long term. This is much more my speed and pace, as I tend to get discouraged over workout programs if I lose my regularity about them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting tired of contacts every day like I&rsquo;ve had for the last 24 years, so I&rsquo;d like to investigate laser eye surgery for 2019.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also had the idea for a few years to get the same or similar tattoo as my <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2006/06/26/grandpa.php">grandfather</a> had from his time in the Filipino navy. After a conversation about tattoos with <a href="https://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> earlier this year, I think 2019 is the year that I make this happen.</p>

<h2>Good for the sole</h2>

<p>I really indulged my sneaker fetish this year. </p>

<p>I added these to my collection: Jordan 1 Mid University Gold; Jordan 1 Retro High OG Top 3; Air Max 97 JDI; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Racer Pink; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Dynamic Yellow; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Cool Grey; Jordan 1 &ldquo;Homage to Home&rdquo;; Jordan 1 Mid Royal Splatter; Puma Roma; Nike Air Safari OG 2018; Jordan 1 Black/White RE2PECT; Nike SF Air Force 1; Jordan 1 Ret Hi NYC; and Air Jordan 1 Retro High.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a side project or two that I'd like to do around my sneaker collection. Maybe 2019 will be the year. Probably not though. </p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>As one who didn&rsquo;t travel much as a kid, I feel very fortunate every year I get to visit other places in the world. In 2018, I took both work and non-work trips to Cambridge, MA; Chicago, IL; Greensboro, NC; Salt Lake City, UT;  Las Vegas, NV; Faroe Islands; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Toronto, Ontario; Marin County, CA; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Strathmere, NJ; Mayfield, OH; Brooklyn, NY; Paris, France; Zurich, Switzerland; Orlando, FL; and Houston, TX. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to visiting more amazing places in 2019.  So far, I&rsquo;ve got trips lined up to Chicago, IL; Austin, TX; Seattle, WA; Boston, MA; and Toronto, Ontario, and likely adding Scotland, New Zealand, Japan, and China to the list.</p>

<h2>Conferences, workshops, and training</h2>

<p>In 2018, I spoke at 11 conferences, both virtually and in-person: <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/design-systems-virtual-summit-2018">UXPin Design Systems Virtual Summit 2018</a>; LoopConf; <a href="https://aycl.uie.com/virtual_seminars/which_new_skills_should_designers_pursue">UIE All You Can Learn Library</a>; Generate Conference NYC; Smashing Conference in <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2018/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/ny-2018/">New York City</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2018"> Washington DC</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/orlando-2018">Orlando</a>; <a href="https://frontendconf.ch/">Frontend Conference</a>; <a href="https://conference.awwwards.com/new-york/">Awwwards Digital Thinkers Conference</a>; and <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/2018">Clarity Conference</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I&rsquo;ll be speaking at <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/event/owner-summit-2019">Owner Summit</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/seattle-2019">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/boston-2019">Boston</a>; and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/">Smashing Conference Toronto</a>. I&rsquo;ll be adding to that list as the year progresses, so watch this space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to add more training to my repertoire in 2019. <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> and I are excited to help designers an developers collaborate better, starting with a <a href="https://designdevjan2019.splashthat.com/">workshop in Philly</a>! We'll be doing a few more of these public workshops throughout the year; more details on that soon. If you&rsquo;re interested in us doing a private workshop for your organization, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> and let&rsquo;s talk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also putting some plans together for some specialized training. I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of resources to help mid-level designers at startups and agencies get over the hump to being art directors and design directors, so I&rsquo;m developing a curriculum specifically for this. It&rsquo;ll likely be about a week-long, intensive workshop. It won&rsquo;t be cheap, but we&rsquo;ll work hard, eat well, and build a strong support network. More on that soon.</p>

<p>Video will be a format I lean into much more for 2019. I'm so inspired by watching my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curlswithcoral/">Coral Rosado</a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/joshluciano?uid=ub6zWFUf0P9Kp8AI6k797A">Josh Luciano</a> grow their skills and audience on their Instagram and YouTube channels, and I already got a decent taste with the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager/expert-advice">Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale</a> series <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a>,  <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>, and I produced with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, as well as <a href="http://skl.sh/superfriendly">my Skillshare class on Design Systems</a>. I&rsquo;ve officially caught the video bug.</p>

<h2>Concerts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a musician since I was 3, but I haven&rsquo;t historically gone to many concerts. In 2018, Em and I changed that by going to see Lauryn Hill, Jennifer Lopez, Kendrick Lamar, Kenny Chesney, Beyonc&eacute; &amp; Jay-Z. We were also going to see Justin Timberlake, but <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/justin-timberlake-tour-cancelation-coachella/">he bruised his vocal chords</a>. Feel better soon, JT.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>I did a decent amount of reading in 2018. I read or started to read <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2BVdMgt">Getting to Yes</a></cite> by Roger Fisher; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnlWai">Principles: Life and Work</a></cite> by Ray Dalio; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ru8X7x">Batman: Nightwalker</a></cite> by Marie Lu; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">The Art of Screen Time</a></cite> by Anya Kamenetz; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</a></cite> by Ramit Sethi; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SseY1M">It Doesn&rsquo;t Have to be Crazy at Work</a></cite> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson; <cite>Batman Vol 1–7</cite> by Tom King; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SwMJ29">Artemis</a></cite> by Andy Weir; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SCV98h">The Snowball System</a> by Mo Bunnell; <a href="https://amzn.to/2CM4qoP">The Spaceship Next Door</a></cite> by Gene Doucett; and <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Sy3bPs">To Sell is Human</a></cite> by Daniel H. Pink. That feels pretty inadequate compared to Em&rsquo;s goal of 100 books every year, but I&rsquo;ll settle for about one per month.</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<ul><li>We got 2 orange tabby kittens: Nala and Simba. They&rsquo;re annoying, but  the kids love them.
</li><li>We&rsquo;ve been inviting friends over semi-regularly for board games and/or karaoke. They&rsquo;re a ton of fun and laughs; more of this in 2019.
</li><li>I attended more funerals and viewings than I cared to this year (or ever), including one for my uncle who was the patriarch of our large extended family, as well as for my former college roommate who passed away from Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fuck cancer.
</li><li>I was <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/915520902607106048">randomly selected for screening at airports</a> 4 times in 2018. 
</li><li>I wrote <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/">11 blog posts</a> in 2018. That's down up from 5 in 2017, down from 12 in 2016, and on par with 11 in 2015. 
</li></ul>

<h2>Clearing my plate for 2019</h2>

<p>Work-wise, I&rsquo;d like to change things a bit in 2019. I&rsquo;ve spent the last few years learning and practicing how to direct projects. That means largely being in charge of the vision for what SuperFriendly teams would make, and how. That also means that while I was involved in many projects, I was rarely directly responsible for the main output myself. </p>

<p>For 2019 projects, I&rsquo;m going to try to be responsible for more output myself. That means I&rsquo;ll be working in design tools and code a lot more. I know I typically tend to be in this mode all by myself, so I&rsquo;m going to challenge myself to continue to work with the same amount of people, but more as a collaborator than a director.</p>

<p>To do this, I know I&rsquo;ll need more familiarity with tools and technologies. I spent some time during the holidays learning the fundamentals of both Rails and Laravel and building a few &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples. I&rsquo;m beefing up my React chops in preparation for a few upcoming projects. I have a post drafted about design tooling. I&rsquo;m learning Swift so I can design and build an iPhone app end-to-end myself.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot. In order to do all of that, I have to clear my plate a bit of things that I think I&rsquo;m done with, either for now or forever. </p>

<p>For the last 6 months or so, I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that certain chapters of my life are closing, while others are opening. But I&rsquo;m not sure which ones are which. So, I&rsquo;ve been taking inventory of all the things in my life, both personally and professionally, to see what things have run their course. This has included everything from taking a sabbatical to moving to a different state to shutting down SuperFriendly and taking a full-time job somewhere to being a full-time stay-at-home dad, and everything in-between. I&rsquo;m not quite ready to share any conclusions from this meditation&mdash;not even sure I have any quite yet&mdash;but there are a few things that are a bit clearer than others.</p>

<ul><li>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/passing-the-superbooked-baton/">passed the baton for SuperBooked</a> to my partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/philipzaengle">Phil Zaengle</a>.  I&rsquo;ll still be involved with this product that I love, but in more less frequent capacity.
</li><li>Unintentionally, I opened a small <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">design and development apprenticeship</a> in 2012. After almost 7 years, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;ve had almost 20 apprentices. That&rsquo;s a lot! I think I&rsquo;ve given all I have to offer here; I no longer have the desire to scratch this particular itch. So, as of 2019, I&rsquo;m closing the apprenticeship. 
</li></ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the opportunities this new year can bring that I have some space for. Bring it on, 2019!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>As I&rsquo;m getting ready to close up shop for the year and recharge for 2019, I&rsquo;m in a reflective mood. Every year, I&rsquo;m incredibly privileged to work with clients that pay me to do something I enjoy, and this year was no exception.</p>                

<p>After <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>&rsquo;s first year of business in 2012, I published <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/superfriendly-annual-report-2012/">an annual report</a> that looked at workload, clients, and tasks at a high level. Visualizing data in aggregate like this has always helped me be intentional what I&rsquo;m currently doing and what I might want to change moving forward.</p>

<p>2019 will mark year seven for SuperFriendly. As a <a href="https://www.adventist.org/en/">Seventh-day Adventist</a>, I&rsquo;m a big believer in the value of cycles of seven, which often bring completeness and wholeness. It seems like an appropriate time for some more reflection.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough breakdown of the distribution of work per year. Clients are represented by their main brand color (at the time of working with them) and roughly sequenced by where the work occurred during the year.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>    
<img src="2018.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2018" /> 

<h2>2017</h2>    
<img src="2017.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2017" /> 

<h2>2016</h2>    
<img src="2016.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2016" /> 

<h2>2015</h2>    
<img src="2015.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2015" /> 

<h2>2014</h2>    
<img src="2014.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2014" /> 

<h2>2013</h2>    
<img src="2013.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2013" /> 

<h2>2012</h2>    
<img src="2012.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2012" />

<p>A few things I noticed when doing this exercise:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I&rsquo;ve long followed the mantra that no single client should be responsible for 50% of revenue, but I also apply that in terms of attention. I&rsquo;m pleased to say that that&rsquo;s held through since day 1. The closest we&rsquo;ve gotten (in terms of attention, not revenue) are a 38% client in 2012, a 32% clients in 2013, and a 37% client in 2015.</li>
    <li>The number of clients per year is slowly dwindling, which I&rsquo;m happy about. We&rsquo;re able to do better work for a smaller number of clients with revenue and profit still increasing. We had 17 clients in 2012, while 2018 wrapped up with 11 clients.</li>
    <li>Attention seems to be normalizing over the years. In 2012, we had a lot of little projects and one gigantic project. This past year, the distribution seems much more even.</li>
    <li>Though you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell by the scale of these graphs, we&rsquo;re spending less time overall on work. The number of hours we&rsquo;ve put in this past year is about 8% lower than we did in 2012, which makes sense if you compare that with the fact that we worked with 6 less clients. But that also means we&rsquo;re spending a little more time with each client.</li>
    <li>Revenue is up 51% from 2012, while profit is down 32%. Hmm, that&rsquo;s definitely something to fix for 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>What did you learn about your business over the last year? What more can I tell you about mine?</p>

<p>Happy holidays, superfriends, and see you all in 2019!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In 2013, I shared an idea I had for better referring work around with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/philipzaengle">Philip Zaengle</a>. Six months later, he came back to me with a prototype of how it might work. Without Phil, <a href="https://superbooked.com/">SuperBooked</a> would still be an idea floating around in my head. We worked on it for two years and then <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/superbooked/">launched SuperBooked</a> to a small audience of friends and testers in August 2016.</p>

<p>But then we slowed down. Alongside making SuperBooked, I run <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> and Phil runs <a href="https://zaengle.com/">Zaengle Corp</a>&mdash;and running our own shops is part of the reason we use SuperBooked ourselves. Our teams run successfully but differently, and mashing them together isn&rsquo;t exactly a recipe for smooth sailing. Phil has staff that move on and off of projects based on production schedules, while my teams expand and contracts on a per project and per pipeline basis. These are neither strengths or weaknesses but operational differences that create logistical challenges when making a product together. Combine that with being (thankfully) busy with client work, and we knew we had to change something.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to make due with a process that&rsquo;s half mine and half Phil&rsquo;s, it makes more sense for one of us to step up and the other to talk a step back. As of today, Phil will become SuperBooked&rsquo;s new <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>. He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s really gotten it to this place so far, and he&rsquo;s the perfect person to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>My role will be more of an advisor to the team. We&rsquo;ll still check in frequently about the ways I think SuperBooked can get ahead of where the industry is headed. I believe in SuperBooked more than ever. I really want to see it come to fruition, and that can best happen if I get out of the way.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of our beta testers for the fantastic feedback and sticking with us while we figure this thing out. And if you&rsquo;re keen on a better way to get and give amazing work, keep your eyes peeled for where SuperBooked goes next.</p>

<p>For the last few years, the majority of my work has been with organizations that either need help creating a design system or need help evolving one. I've been fortunate to do that with with my superfriends and colleagues <a href="http://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a> and <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>.  We've worked both individually and collectively with organizations like <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html">ExxonMobil</a>, the <a href="http://superfriend.ly/helped/seventh-day-adventist-church/">General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists</a>, athenahealth, Target, <abbr>IQVIA</abbr>, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Progressive Insurance, Rescue.org, and more. Now, we&rsquo;ve partnered with our superfriends at InVision to share some of our learnings with the world. We&rsquo;re proud to to announce <a href="https://invs.io/2AN0mnb">Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale</a>!

<p>We&rsquo;ll be releasing a few more episodes over the coming months on topics like getting buy-in, collaboration, governance, and more. Enjoy!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>On <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/329-dan-mall-building-portfolio/">Episode 329</a> of <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a>, I joined <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> and <a href="https://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> to talk about the role <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/portfolios/">portfolios</a> have in getting a ful-time job, and how you can increase your odds of getting a job. We talked about many things, one of which was the all-time popular objection: &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have anything good to put in my portfolio!&rdquo; So, we&rsquo;re putting our money where our mouth is and looking for an up-and-coming new designer to work with me to redesign the Shop Talk Show website!
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/on-creative-direction/">creative direct</a> it, you design it. That means I&rsquo;ll be providing oversight, ideas, inspiration, and guidance while you do the actual pixel-pushing in Sketch/Photoshop/Figma/whatever to make the screens we&rsquo;ll all need. Chris and Dave act as clients, but will also be coding what we come up with.</p>

<p>We want this to be an opportunity for a designer who might have have something like it otherwise. If you have lots of portfolio pieces, this probably isn&rsquo;t the gig for you. If you work full-time as a designer somewhere, this probably isn&rsquo;t the gig for you.</p>

<p>Some criteria for our ideal designer:</p>

<ul>                    
    <li>You&rsquo;re in an underrepresented group in this field.</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;re looking to change careers from whatever you&rsquo;re currently doing into becoming a full-time designer.</li>
    <li>You need an opportunity like this project to break into the field, because you&rsquo;ve had a difficult time getting someone to hire you to do design work for them.</li>
    <li>You have some tolerance for hard work and transparency. Chris, Dave, and I all have an affinity for <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/">working in public</a>, so that&rsquo;ll likely be some part of this. Be prepared for some amount of live-streaming conversations, posting work before it&rsquo;s done, and being able to publicly track the progress of this work.</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;re a Shop Talk Show listener (at have least listened to an episode or two).</li>
</ul>

<p>Still here? Great! We&rsquo;re taking applications for this opportunity until about October 1, at which time we&rsquo;ll sort through the applications to see if there&rsquo;s a good fit. Without further ado&hellip;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://shoptalkshow.superfriend.ly/">Apply here!</a></strong></p>

<p>Chris, Dave, and I would love any comments or feedback you have about how we can make this better for everyone involved (including everyone sitting on the sidelines, watching all this unfold). If you have any questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall">tweet at me</a>, either publicly or privately.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make something great!</p>

		</author>
		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Think about the last time at work you thought, or, better yet, said the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe you wrote some code that you were proud of, and you thought, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m good at my job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or maybe someone suggested you do a little more work that you wanted to, and you declined by saying, &ldquo;No thanks, I&rsquo;m good with what I&rsquo;m doing right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or maybe you lent a co-worker some cash and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadly, we probably don&rsquo;t acknowledge our good as often as we should. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/chairman/212045/world-broken-workplace.aspx">a Gallup's World Poll</a>, only 15% of the world&rsquo;s 1 billion full-time workers are engaged at work. In fact, Gallup even goes so far to say we&rsquo;re in an &ldquo;employee engagement crisis.&rdquo; I bet that statistic likely applies to the readers of this piece too: 85% of you are likely unengaged at your jobs, and you may not even know why.</p>


<h2>Project Aristotle</h2>

<p>In 2013, a team in Google&rsquo;s People Operations&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they call their &ldquo;human resources department&rdquo;&mdash;set out to determine what makes for effective teams at Google. Lead researcher Julia Rozovsky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html">reports her findings</a>, dubbed &ldquo;Project Aristotle.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;We were pretty confident that we'd find the perfect mix of individual traits and skills necessary for a stellar team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, they found that &ldquo;who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.&rdquo; And of all the factors involved, what was the one that emerged as the most important?</p>

<p><strong>Psychological safety.</strong></p>

<p>They found that individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are less likely to leave Google, they&rsquo;re more likely to harness the power of diverse ideas from their teammates, they bring in more revenue, and they&rsquo;re rated as effective twice as often by executives.</p>

<p>So, what can you do right away to start creating more safety within your teams? Perhaps you could encourage your team to kick off meetings by sharing a risk taken in the previous week. Make that part of the culture of how you get work done. If you&rsquo;re not a manager, talk to your manager about implementing something like this, and be willing to lead by example by being the first to share.</p>

<p>Some of you might be thinking, &ldquo;Yeah, that could work pretty well at my job.&rdquo; But I bet others of you are thinking, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that would work for my teams. It&rsquo;s just so opposite of how we work right now.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s totally fair. For some, taking risks just isn&rsquo;t part of the culture of work; it&rsquo;s not part of your team&rsquo;s norms. Your boss tells you what to do you, and you do it, because there&rsquo;s likely some consequence waiting for you if you don&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>How do you turn that kind of situation around into a healthy one? You can start by establishing good boundaries.</p>


<h2>Boundaries</h2>

<p>If you own a house, everything inside the walls counts as part of your property. Your property also likely extends outside your house to your front yard and back yard. The boundary is clear. You get to decide who enters your property&mdash;your boundaries&mdash;and who doesn&rsquo;t. Your friends and family can likely come in, at your invitation. Strangers that threaten you cannot come in, and you may even call help like the police or a really strong friend to get them outside of your boundaries completely.</p>

<p>The same is true physically, mentally, and emotionally. You have boundaries that no one should cross unless you allow them to. Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to identify when someone crosses a boundary. If someone touches you without your permission, they&rsquo;re crossing your physical boundaries.</p>

<p>Others are more difficult to identify. When your parent guilt trips you into visiting to be a good son or daughter, they&rsquo;re crossing your emotional boundaries. Luckily, like building stronger or taller fences, we can practice strengthening our boundaries and there are great resources to help us do this.</p>

<p>One of the my favorites is the aptly-titled <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NEVvfi" title="Buy &ldquo;Boundaries&rdquo; on Amazon">Boundaries</a></cite> by psychologists Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend. In it are great nuggets like, &ldquo;Boundaries let the good in and keep the bad out.&rdquo; This book defines boundaries and gives examples&mdash;allegory-style&mdash;of how to put them into practice.</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a variation that&rsquo;s specific to organizations as opposed to personal relationships, there&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2p6cGbF" title="Buy &ldquo;Boundaries for Leaders&ldquo; on Amazon">Boundaries for Leaders</a></cite>, which offers practical advice on how to manage teams, coach direct reports, and instill an organization with strong values and culture.</p>

<p>Another great resource is counselor Nina Brown&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NHiS7P" title="Buy &ldquo;Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People&rdquo; on Amazon">Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People</a></cite>. She describes four types of boundaries:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Soft boundaries:</strong> when your boundaries merge with other people's. People with soft boundaries are easily victims of psychological manipulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Spongy boundaries:</strong> when you&rsquo;re unsure of what to let in and what to keep out.</li>
    <li><strong>Rigid boundaries:</strong> when you&rsquo;re closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally. Rigid boundaries are often the result of physical or emotional trauma.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible boundaries:</strong> when you decide what to let in and what to keep out. People with flexible boundaries are often resistant to emotional contagion and psychological manipulation and are difficult to exploit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having flexible boundaries are what all of us can likely do better. Let&rsquo;s have a look at flexible boundaries in action.</p>

<p>Quinta has excellent flexible boundaries. She decides what to let in and what to keep out. She was resistant to psychological manipulation. She was difficult to exploit.</p>

<p>For those that learn and practice boundaries for the first time, there&rsquo;s often a big initial reaction: <strong>but isn&rsquo;t that rude?</strong> Let&rsquo;s be clear: it&rsquo;s not rude. It&rsquo;s not rude to say no to someone. It&rsquo;s not rude to want something different than everyone else and stand up for it. Quinta wasn&rsquo;t obnoxious or off-putting; she was pleasant and accommodating, but she still made she sure that <em>she</em> was in control of what she wanted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a complex concept in the Boundaries book: &ldquo;<strong>We are responsible <em>to</em> others and <em>for</em> ourselves.</strong>&rdquo; The corollary is that we are not responsible for others. The other two guys in this video were probably worried about hurting Justin&rsquo;s feelings. And that&rsquo;s where the complexity sneaks in: by making themselves responsible for Justin&rsquo;s feelings, by taking that on themselves, they&rsquo;re actually encroaching on Justin&rsquo;s boundaries in making assumptions on behalf of his emotions. They&rsquo;re probably well-intentioned, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it&rsquo;s still a boundary violation.</p>

<p>One of the most common scenarios of unintentional boundary violations is in taking care of someone, for example, an aging parent or perhaps a relative or friend with a mental illness. The <a href="https://www.nami.org/">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> has some <a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Family-Members-and-Caregivers/Maintaining-a-Healthy-Relationship">great tips on maintaining a relationship with someone with a mental illness</a> that, not surprisingly, include setting clear boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Tell your relative the standards you need him to meet so you can live well together. Make sure your loved one knows that you see him as a whole person, and that you expect him to follow those standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often think that mental illness means mental disorders, like schizophrenia or depression or dementia. And while these disorders are forms of mental illness, they&rsquo;re not always as evident. <abbr>NAMI</abbr> defines mental illness as &ldquo;a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling, or mood.&rdquo; That condition could be stress. Or anger. Really, any one of us can experience conditions that affect our thinking and feelings at any time.</p>

<p>Essentially, setting clear boundaries is excellent way to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone. Strong boundaries are a prerequisite to creating <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/accountability/">accountability</a>.</p>

<h2>Accountability</h2>

<p>When now-Senator Corey Booker was mayor of Newark, <abbr title="New Jersey">NJ</abbr>, he helped realize unprecedented violent crime reduction and increased affordable housing in the city all while reducing the city budget deficit.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to hear him speak at <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/2012/">Brooklyn Beta in 2012</a>. During the <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> session, someone asked how he and his team are able to achieve such incredible results. He responded by saying that they all hold each other accountable and proceeded to share his formula for accountability. There are 3 parts:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Stated standards</strong>. Having stated standards is the foundation of accountability. One can only be held accountable if both parties agree to the same standard.</li>
    <li><strong>A system of measurements.</strong> Both parties need to agree on a way to measure if they&rsquo;ve met said standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Effects: either positive, negative, or both.</strong> Both parties need to agree on what will happen after those standards are met and/or those standards are not met.</li>
</ol>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re talking to your manager. You might say something like:</p> 

<blockquote><p>This functionality will be done by end of day today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your manager may try to be more specific in order to make sure you have a defined standard. Maybe you could be more specific about what functionality. And what time is the end of the day? Midnight? Close of business?</p>

<blockquote><p><del>This functionality</del> <ins>The ability to upload a document</ins> will be done by <del>end of day</del> <ins>5pm Eastern</ins> today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This can easily be measured. Your manager may check the staging server at 5:01pm to test this functionality to see if it&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>The last piece of creating accountability is that there must be effects, either positive or negative once those standards are measured. If that upload functionality works by 5:01pm, you get a promotion! But if it doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;or worse: isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;by 5:01pm you get fired.</p>

<p>Ok, so that&rsquo;s a pretty extreme and unlikely example. Maybe this is more realistic. If that upload functionality works by 5:01pm, our client will probably sign more work with us. But if it doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;or worse: isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;by 5:01pm, they probably won't renew the account.</p>

<p>If your teams aren&rsquo;t being productive, there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t being held accountable. You can use this framework to help correct that; it&rsquo;s at least worth a shot.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of teams fall down is in the first piece: teams struggle to define standards well. Next time you&rsquo;re in a meeting and you hear someone punt on defining standards by trying to finish the conversation with something like, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see how it turns out,&rdquo; speak up. You can say something like, &ldquo;Wait, can we try to define that a little more specifically so we know what we&rsquo;re accountable for?&rdquo; Little conversational cues like that can go a long way.</p>



<h2>Commit to commit</h2>

<p>Once everyone&rsquo;s on board with that idea, the next step is to create some commitments. Here&rsquo;s where boundaries come back into play. You want to create accountability without violating anyone&rsquo;s boundaries. A great way to d o that is to ask a closed-ended question, a question that you can only answer with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>

<aside>

    <p>It seems a bit counterintuitive: we tend to hear much more often about <a href="https://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/interviews/open-ended-questions.html">the value of open-ended questions</a> to stimulate deep conversation. But creating accountability is about the opposite. You&rsquo;re not looking to encourage conversation; instead, creating commitments are often about drawing conversations to a close.</p>

</aside>

<blockquote><p><strong>Can you</strong> finish the document upload functionality by 5pm today?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;can you&rdquo; allows the other person to make their own decisions. It respects their boundaries.</p>

<p>What if you&rsquo;re on the other end of this? What if your boss comes up to you and asks you this? That&rsquo;s not always a comfortable spot to be in.</p>

<p>There are two obvious ways to answer this: <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong>. But most people forget about a third and very powerful answer to this question.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not <strong>maybe</strong>. It&rsquo;s not <strong>I don&rsquo;t know</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s to <strong>commit to commit</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I can tell you by 3pm today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is really powerful. What&rsquo;s your boss looking for? They just want to know what to expect. And you&rsquo;re letting them know that, very soon, they&rsquo;ll know what to expect.</p>

<aside>

    <p>I learned about this technique in a wonderful workshop with executive coach/consultant <a href="http://www.chalmersbrothers.com/about">Chalmers Brothers</a>. If you get an opportunity to attend any of his events, don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>

</aside>

<p>Once you get good at each of these three types of answers, you can start mixing and matching.</p>

<blockquote><p>No, but I can get to it by 6pm. Will that work for you?</p></blockquote>

<p>This is no longer just an interrogation about accountability; it&rsquo;s a conversation about it.</p> 

<p>Let&rsquo;s take what we&rsquo;ve learned so far and see if we can debunk one of the most used but most toxic strategies. </p>


<h2>Underpromise, overdeliver</h2>

<p>Do you use this technique? If you do, please stop. Please. It&rsquo;s awful and manipulative.</p>

<p>Why do I hate it so much? Well, it has another name that you might be familiar with.</p>

<p><strong>Lying</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how this works.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Me, at 3pm:</strong> Sorry, I won&rsquo;t have that upload functionality done by 5pm today.<br />
	<strong>Client:</strong> Ok, thanks for letting me know.<br />
	<strong>Me, at 5pm:</strong> Here&rsquo;s that upload functionality!<br />
	<strong>Client:</strong> Um ok. I thought we weren&rsquo;t gonna get this today. Cool&hellip; I guess?
</p>

<p>What happened here? Above all, I think people just want to know what to expect. They want to know that your word means something, that when you say you&rsquo;ll do it, you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being wrong. If at 3pm, you don&rsquo;t think you can get something done but at 5pm you realize it was easier than you initially thought, that&rsquo;s great! But own it. Don&rsquo;t celebrate finishing early before you apologize for setting the wrong expectations. That way, your client will know that you value your word as much as they want to.</p>

<aside>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve seen lots of people use &ldquo;underpromise, overdeliver&rdquo; as a strategy. As in, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to promise in advance that we&rsquo;ll do less than we actually intend to, then we&rsquo;ll deliver more than they expect but we intended all along.&rdquo; This is dishonest. Stop it. All people will learn about you is that the words you say never match your deliveries. This is a terrible way to build trust.</p>

</aside>

<p>One of my philosophies about doing client work&mdash;and this applies equally if your client is instead a manager or another internal stakeholder&mdash;is to <strong>show clients the future</strong>. Let them know what&rsquo;s coming up.</p> 

<p>For every client, I set up a <a href="https://github.com/SuperFriendly/project-hub">Project Hub</a> on a new subdomain. It&rsquo;s a simple list of all of the upcoming milestones. As we go, it&rsquo;s ok if things shift, but we&rsquo;re always trying to reset expectations so the client always has an accurate view that&rsquo;s far out as we can confidently say.</p>



<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>One of the tough things about accountability is that you may run into someone that&rsquo;s honestly difficult to make accountable. Despite trying to establish standards, conceiving a great way to measure those, and having appropriate effects, nothing seems to be working. In that scenario, chances are pretty high that you&rsquo;re dealing with an unmotivated colleague or direct report.</p>

<p>Maybe that person is you, despite trying your best to drum up the interest to no avail.</p>

<p>I recently worked with a startup that asked me to coach their teams to level up their collaborative processes. In particular, they thought the designers&rsquo; work wasn&rsquo;t exactly up to snuff with what they could be producing, so they asked me to see what I could unearth. They don&rsquo;t have a head of design, so the head of engineering has been standing in as head of design to get the designers moving.</p>

<p>When I asked the head of engineering what the root of the problem might be, he said, &ldquo;Listen, we have to ship this product so we don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to explore. We have to execute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I asked the designers what the root of the problem might be, they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just taking orders designing what everyone tells us to do.&rdquo;</p> 

<p>How do you fix this scenario?</p>

<p>In Daniel Pink&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Qq9Sm9" title="Buy &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; on Amazon">Drive</a></cite>, he describes a framework for what drives people, what motivates them:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> the desire to direct our own lives.</li>
    <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> the urge to make progress and get better and something that matters to us.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>The designers had none of these three, so it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that they didn&rsquo;t feel driven or motivated. People were telling them what to design, so they had no autonomy; they couldn&rsquo;t direct their own lives. They were being managed by someone who didn&rsquo;t know their skills, so they had little idea for how to make progress. The startup is in financial services, a category the designers didn&rsquo;t have too much interest in, so there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of purpose in it for them either.</p>

<p>So, we tried to carve out some space for each designer to practice at least one of these. We did about 2 weeks worth of design work, so the engineers had their hands full for a while. Now that the designers had some free time, we looked for autonomous spaces for them to practice some mastery.</p>
<p>One of the designers wanted to explore how illustration could make the app warmer, so he spent the next 2 weeks compiling reference material, sketching, and having a ton of fun. The other designer wanted to tighten up their not-so-used component library with updated code samples and guidelines, so she went to town on that. Seeing how well it was going, the head of engineering committed to letting them keep some space where they got to rule their own domains. A few weeks later, the team is a well-oiled machine that&rsquo;s seeing much more involvement and fire from everyone.</p>



<h2>From selfish to selfless</h2>

<p>The things discussed above are techniques to cover your own butt. Creating accountability, making commitments, and finding motivation are all foundational to creating a culture of work where everyone&rsquo;s boundaries are respected. But that stuff just makes teams functional; it&rsquo;s not what makes things great. I&rsquo;ve heard <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr> of Design Education for InVision <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a> likes to say, &ldquo;No one settles for a meal that&rsquo;s edible. They want it to be delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teams where everyone is selfish are the making for dysfunction. That&rsquo;s probably not news to you. Most teams, though, end up with self-centered team members. People aren&rsquo;t selfish in a malicious way; it&rsquo;s just that everyone&rsquo;s looking out for themselves, because who else would?</p>

<p>We have to try to push our teams further. In order to create psychological safety, team members need to be looking out for each other more.</p>

<p><a href="https://startwithwhy.com/">Simon Sinek</a> is probably best known for <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/simon_sinek" title="Simon Sinek on TED">his TED talks</a> and his book <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Okp4zU" title="Buy &ldquo;Start with Why&rdquo; on Amazon">Start with Why</a></cite>, but his book <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NzLekz" title="Buy &ldquo;Leaders Eat Last&rdquo; on Amazon">Leaders Eat Last</a></cite> is my favorite. It gives so many great tips and examples for how teams can be better supporting each other.</p>

<p>In the book, Sinek tells the story of an employee at manufacturing company whose diabetic wife needed surgery. The employee couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose pay, so his fellow employees transferred their own paid vacation days so he could have more paid days off. The company had never done something like this before, and it was actually in clear violation of official company policy. But they made it happen anyway. It&rsquo;s a touching tale of how people band together to reduce each other&rsquo;s risk.</p>

<p>Sinek also tells the story of a tech company <a href="http://www.nextjump.com/">Next Jump</a>&rsquo;s Lifetime Employment Policy: once you get hired, you can never be fired (unless you actively worked to undermine your colleagues or do something illegal). If you perform poorly, you don&rsquo;t get fired; you get coached. <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> Charlie Kim thinks of taking care of his employees like raising kids. He says, &ldquo;Most people would never get rid of their kids in hard times, so how can we lay off our people under the same conditions?&rdquo;

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple illustration of how are organizations currently work, but how they could be so much more.</p>

<h2>What can I do for you today?</h2>

<p>My last tip: go around to each member of your team and ask them what you can do for them today. Don&rsquo;t take no for an answer (while still respecting their boundaries!). It could be work-related, like converting a database or naming all the layers in a Sketch file. Or it could be as small as making sure everyone has a fresh glass of water once an hour.</p>

<p>This is the kind of stuff that makes not only our workplaces good, but our neighborhoods, and cities, and countries too. This is the stuff you won&rsquo;t pick up in a coding bootcamp or in a Github repo, but it can make all the difference for <strong>how to be good at work</strong>.</p>

<p>
    For designers and developers, one thing stands high above r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, cover letters, and university degrees: the esteemed portfolio. A great portfolio can get you a high-paying, life-restoring job, even if you don’t have much or any schooling. The converse is also true: you may have many degrees and lots of experience listed on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but unless you can demonstrate it through a portfolio, that great job opportunity may still pass you by. 
</p>

<p>What makes for a good portfolio? In a sentence, <strong>a portfolio that has the highest likelihood of landing a job indicates you already have the skills to do what you&rsquo;ll be hired to do.</strong> Will you be expected to design inventive user interfaces for senior citizens? That&rsquo;s what should be in your portfolio. Is that potential job expecting that you&rsquo;ll build React apps using Redux and LotusNotes? Time to break out that &ldquo;Domino for Dummies&rdquo; book.</p> 

<p>Many designers and developers think of a portfolio as a simple way to collect the things they&rsquo;ve worked on over the last few years of their careers. While that might make your mama proud, it&rsquo;s a distraction from the fact that a portfolio has a job to do—namely, to get you a job.</p>

<aside>

    <p>If you do want to collect your work somewhere, call it a &ldquo;time capsule&rdquo; or &ldquo;archive.&rdquo; And while those might <strong>help</strong> to get you a job, there are much better ways to land your dream gig than by just putting a random smattering of work in a place.</p>

</aside>

<p>Therefore, the first step in crafting a great portfolio is identifying what job you&rsquo;re actually trying to get. Half of that is identifying the company you&rsquo;d like to work for; the other half is identifying the specific job you want at that company. Once you know those things, you can create a specific message that addresses why you&rsquo;d be a great fit for <em>that</em> job at <em>that</em> company.</p>

<p>You might already see the conundrum with that approach: even with the same title, every job is at least slightly different from company to company. A <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/about/careers-list/?job_id=Senior-Product-Designer-464419">Senior Product Designer job at online medical care appointment booking service Zocdoc</a> is different than a <a href="https://www.plated.com/careers?gh_jid=1169776">Senior Product Designer job at meal kit service Plated</a>. There&rsquo;s certainly overlap in the details: both companies are in New York, involve interdisciplinary collaboration, and require facilitation as well as execution skills. But the big stuff couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Plated is looking for a designer to &ldquo;help them craft beautiful and engaging experiences that help people transform dinnertime.&rdquo; Zocdoc is looking for a designer to help create &ldquo;the next generation of patient and provider experiences to help us transform healthcare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How could one portfolio possibly communicate both messages clearly? There probably aren&rsquo;t many designers out there that already have the skills and experience to rethink meals <em>and</em> transform healthcare. Hiring managers know this. At best, a singular portfolio would probably only be able to abstract the messages to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at creating experiences.&rdquo; See how much more watered down that is? By generalizing, you put the onus on the person evaluating your portfolio to draw their own conceptual line between your experience and their needs. A good portfolio would do that work for them.</p>

<aside>

    <p>Remember, most managers don&rsquo;t have training in being managers. No one ever taught them <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/interviewing-designers/">how to interview designers</a> or developers. The easier you make their jobs&mdash;finding and landing qualified candidates&mdash;by presenting yourself as the person they&rsquo;ve been looking for, the better the outcome for you.</p>

</aside>

<p>Which brings us to this potentially unpopular guideline for portfolios: <strong>every job you apply for should have its own portfolio.</strong> That&rsquo;s right: if you&rsquo;re applying for 4 jobs, you should have 4 different portfolios. A great portfolio shows the hiring manager why you&rsquo;re perfect for <em>that</em> job, and perhaps that job <a href="/onlyness/">only</a>. That means it may be a bad fit if you tried to reuse the same portfolio for another another job without at least significant modifications.</p>

<p>Whenever I mention this Multiple Portfolio Strategy&trade; to designers and developers looking for new jobs, they scoff. It&rsquo;s difficult enough to create one portfolio; tripling or quadrupling that effort seems virtually impossible. But let&rsquo;s appropriately qualify expectations: you&rsquo;re looking for a hiring manager to agree to pay you tens&mdash;or even hundreds&mdash;of thousands of dollars a year, based on something you whip together in a weekend? A good portfolio is an <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/investments/">investment</a>: the larger initial loss you can take in terms of how much effort you can put it, the larger the potential for gain at the end of that process.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="dm-c-pullquote_text">How easily can I already see this person working here? A great portfolio answers that question as clearly possible before any in-person interviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite recent example of these guidelines in action is <a href="https://www.francineforspotify.com/">the site Francine Tamakloe put together to apply at Spotify</a>. This site speaks directly to the role music has played in her life. She uses Spotify&rsquo;s typographic style and gradient color palette. She frames her work style via song lyrics and embeds a Spotify player of each song nearby. I don&rsquo;t know the details, but <a href="https://twitter.com/tamakloeee">her Twitter bio</a> says she&rsquo;s now &ldquo;hustlin&rsquo; at Spotify,&rdquo; and I can imagine this site played a big part in that.</p>

<p>Imagine if she wanted to work at Apple too. A simple &ldquo;Find &amp; Replace&rdquo; from &ldquo;Spotify&rdquo; to &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t really do the trick. This is a &ldquo;go big or go home&rdquo; approach. So many designers and developers think of their portfolios as &ldquo;one size fits all,&rdquo; and then are baffled as to why they can&rsquo;t land any job, much less their dream one.</p>


<h2>A template for a great portfolio</h2>

<p>In evaluating potential candidates, many hiring managers have criteria that looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Does the candidate have the skills to succeed at this job?</strong> For example, can they already write Rails code for apps that millions of people use simultaneously? Or, can they take a concept from a whiteboard sketch to a polished interface design without much help from others?</li>
    <li><strong>Can the candidate prove that they have the skills to succeed at this job?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>If they don&rsquo;t already have the skills, how long would it take to learn them?</strong> Each organization has its own tolerance for this. Organizations under stakeholder and/or shareholder pressure may want you to get up to speed in a few weeks, while others may be willing to give you up to a year to get your bearings. Beware: this tolerance is rarely discussed internally or even acknowledged. It&rsquo;s often &ldquo;just a feeling&rdquo; that the hiring manager may have.</li>
    <li><strong>How well would the candidate fit in here?</strong> Are they like everyone else on the team? If not, is the difference one that will make everyone here better or make everyone here feel awkward?</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the specific criteria will likely vary, it can often be summarized like this: <strong>how easily can I already see this person working here?</strong> A great portfolio answers that question as clearly as possible <em>before</em> any in-person interviews.</p>

<p>What could that portfolio look like?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to apply for this <a href="https://jobs.nike.com/job/beaverton/senior-designer-north-america-retail-experience-design/824/9118910">Senior Designer, North America Retail Experience Design position</a> at Nike. First, I&rsquo;d find the person or people who may be reviewing this, and I&rsquo;d address it to them. For this job, I might address it to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/otake/">Junichi Otake</a>, Experience Design Director Retail Innovation at Nike. I don&rsquo;t know him personally, but I have 50 mutual connections with him on LinkedIn, so perhaps I could have someone who knows us both introduce us.</p>

<p>As far as the content of that portfolio goes, here&rsquo;s a rough wireframe of what that might be on there:</p>

<img src="http://danmall.com/articles/portfolios/portfolio-template.svg" alt="A portfolio template" />

<p>The important bits:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>An opening statement,</strong> addressed to a particular person, introducing myself and stating clearly why I&rsquo;d be a great fit for the position.</li>
    <li><strong>A collection of my work,</strong> specifically tailored to speak to this particular job description. For example, this job description uses specific phrases like &ldquo;product presentation&ldquo; and &ldquo;retail business targets,&rdquo; so I used those same phrases in talking about my work.</li>
    <li><strong>Something special about me</strong> professionally or personally that sets me above everyone else applying for this job. I&rsquo;m not just another designer; I&rsquo;m a designer that&rsquo;s also a sneakerhead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: this is a love letter to your dream job, so pour as much of yourself into it as you can! As you can probably tell, I used the most vanilla layout I could for this example, but the finished version is another opportunity to show you&rsquo;re right for the company. Bonus points for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using the same/similar typefaces and color scheme as the company</li>
    <li>Referencing some extra research you did, like info from a podcast or a trade magazine</li>
    <li>Pictures of you attending that company&rsquo;s events, evidence of you being a longtime customer, or other things that may distinguish you from other candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>The intention here is to answer some of the questions the hiring manager might have before they even ask it. For example, they may think, &ldquo;How would Dan would handle working on Nike+, which has both digital and physical components?&ldquo; I answer that&mdash;in advance, in my portfolio, before they actually ask me&mdash;in my portfolio piece for Crayola, which has both digital and physical components. They might wonder, &ldquo;Would Dan work well on a large team like ours?&rdquo; Which I answer in portfolio pieces about working with different team sizes. They might be curious as to whether or not I&rsquo;d even like working there, to which my sneaker fetish callouts would answer that it&rsquo;d be a slice of heaven for me. You get the idea.</p>

<h2>Reframing portfolios (even if only in your own mind)</h2>

<p>(<em>Note: this section was added September 7, 2018, five days after the article&rsquo;s initial publishing.</em>)</p>

<p>In response to this article, design Fedor Shkliarau <a href="https://twitter.com/shkliarau/status/1037003567608066048" title="A Twitter conversation between Fedor Shkliarau and Dan Mall">pointed out</a> that this may be more of a cover letter than a portfolio . Through that discussion, we arrived at the best term for something like this is <strong>a proposal</strong>. After I <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/prequalifying-clients/">prequalify clients</a> for <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> projects, I&rsquo;ll often put together a collection&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s a short email of links or a 100-page, beautifully-designed <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>&mdash;of past work that&rsquo;s contextualized to the particular problem they&rsquo;re asking us to help them solve.</p>

<aside>

    <p>For the pedants among us, you&rsquo;re right that the definition of &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;a collection of past work, used to demonstrate ability.&rdquo; However, for designers and developers, the connotation of the word has been elevated to often be the sole determinant in whether or not one is awarded a job. Though I believe we could use a new word to represent this idea, &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; is the word our industry currently uses, so it seems more pragmatic in the short-term to clarify its intent as opposed to getting people to change what word they use.</p>

</aside>

<p>A good portfolio is no different. In fact, it may even be easier to put together than a services inquiry. With a services inquiry, I sometimes know very little about the company, and all I have to rely on for my response is a short conversation I may have had with a client. With a portfolio for an agency, you have all of their past work to look at to determine what&rsquo;s important to them. With a portfolio for a startup or product shop, you can look at the product(s) they make to understand what kind of company they are. For both, you can also research some of the people who work there to find out what qualities and skills they posses that landed them their jobs.</p>

<p>Thinking of this as a proposal instead of a portfolio can justify why it should be custom every time and help free you from the standard thinking that they way to get a job is to send a link to your online junk drawer or past projects.</p>

<p>While none of this is a plug-and-play template, I hope this gives you a starting point for how to spruce up your <del>portfolio</del> <ins>proposal</ins> to say the appropriate things in appropriate ways to the people you want to hire you. Happy job hunting!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The way designers and developers work together today is broken. It&rsquo;s too siloed and separate; &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; is a fantasy that few enjoy.</p>

<p>The state of advertising in the 1940s was similar. The all-powerful copywriter took what the clients wanted to say&mdash;usually simply the features of their product&mdash;and turned it into a headline and body copy. Then, they&rsquo;d hand that copy to an account executive who would run it to another floor and literally slide that paper under a door to the art department to &ldquo;visualize&rdquo; the final ad. Artists simply followed the copywriter&rsquo;s orders. It was very rare that the copywriter and the artist would actually know each other.</p>

<p>All of that changed when copywriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bernbach">Bill Bernbach</a> met art director <a href="http://www.paul-rand.com/">Paul Rand</a>. Rand once remarked about working with Bernbach, &ldquo;This was my first encounter with a copywriter who understood visual ideas and who didn&rsquo;t come in with a yellow copy pad and a preconceived notion of what the layout should look like.&rdquo; Contrary to the siloed dynamic at the time, they&rsquo;d take lunch breaks together to visit art museums and galleries; they became good friends.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/designer-developer-workflow/vw.jpg" alt="" />
	<figcaption>The famous Volkswagen ads created at DDB under Berbach&rsquo;s direction</figcaption>
<figure>
   
<p>Their collaborative working style led to the birth of the idea of &ldquo;the creative team,&rdquo; the mutual respect and partnership between art director and copywriter that tended to yield unique results. Bob Gage, an art director that worked for <a href="http://www.ddb.com/">DDB</a>, the agency Bernbach co-founded, described it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Two people who respect each other sit in the same room for a length of time and arrive at a state of&hellip; free association, where the mention of one idea will lead to another idea, then to another. The art director might suggest a headline, the writer a visual. The entire ad is conceived as a whole, in a kind of ping pong between disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what we all strive for in our jobs True collaboration with equals and partners? Ideas that build off one another? Why does this seem so far away for some of us?</p> 

<h2>A new workflow in action</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to work fairly often with my good friend <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>, and one of the things I love most about working with him is that we both actively pursue that ping pong momentum within our collective work.</p>

<p>Brad and I both do our fair share of workshops with designers and developers that would love to have a more collaborative dynamic with their co-workers. While they&rsquo;re all typically on-board with the theory of collaborating more, they also seemed a bit stumped as to what that actually looks like from minute to minute.</p>

<p>So, Brad and I decided to record an almost-two-hour-long video of us working together:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnkrUt7PpnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that we cover in here, and we barely scratch the surface. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of concepts we cover in this walkthrough:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Working quickly and roughly with <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">element collages</a></li>
    <li>The importance of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/">workshop and storefront</a> environments</li>
    <li><a href="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/">Stealing from and remixing</a> existing interfaces to create something original</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system-redux/">folly of relying too heavily on static design tools</a></li>
    <li>A reminder that <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/">development is design</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And lots more! In fact, we barely even finish the page we&rsquo;re working on, mostly because we&rsquo;re talking through what we&rsquo;re doing rather than solely doing the work. If there&rsquo;s enough interest, we may do a few more of these so you can see it all come to fruition.</p>

<p>For more info, please check out Brad&rsquo;s thoughts about all of this in his post, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designer-developer-workflow">Designer + Developer Workflow</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d love to hear any feedback you might have about all this. Is this a new kind of workflow for you? Is this how you&rsquo;ve worked for years? Interested in working this way at your company but not sure where to start? Let us know what questions you have, and thanks for reading and watching!</p>

<p>Over a year ago, Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine asked me if I&rsquo;d be game to do a conference talk without slides, something more about showing work in action.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/smashing-conference-toronto-2018/smashing-live.png" alt="The initial message from Vitaly Friedman about a &ldquo;no slides&rdquo; conference" />

<p>I was immediately excited to do it, as I could immediately think of how I&rsquo;d do that, since I do that almost daily with <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">my apprentices</a>. (I previously wrote down the details of that framework in <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/">Stealing Your Way to Original Designs</a>.)</p>

<p>I normally don&rsquo;t stress too much about talks nowadays as I&rsquo;ve given <a href="/speaking-podcasts/">my fair share</a> of them, but this one was a bit different. Trying to do final prep the night before was difficult, because I didn&rsquo;t have slides to review. Also, because of the format of the talk, I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to prep extensively. Too much prep might dilute the whole concept of showing how I make decisions while designing.</p>

<p>So I decided the best prep would probably to get the best night&rsquo;s sleep I could get.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I gave that talk.</p>

<p>I planned to redesign the <abbr title="Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services"><a href="https://www.raicestexas.org/">RAICES</a></abbr> site on stage. In my rough rehearsals, I designed a fair bit of the site. On stage, all I got to was buttons. 😶</p>

<p>I walked off stage uneasy about the talk, and felt uneasy about it all day. One thing I&rsquo;m most proud of is my talks is feeling like like share <em>a lot</em>. With this one, I don&rsquo;t think I shared enough. The feedback I got from attendees was all nice, but I also know that people who hated it probably wouldn&rsquo;t come up to me to say so.</p>

<p>After sleeping on it though, now I feel great about the talk. Two pieces of feedback I got that stand out:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A few designers felt validated in their processes by seeing mine.</li>
    <li>A few developers said design felt less intimidating now, both to understand as well as to try.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a speaker, that&rsquo;s more than a great outcome. Upon reflection, getting an outcome like that without spending weeks and months laboring over crafting the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; narrative for just the right sequence and quantity of slides is wonderful!</p>

<p>I tend to view my talks as a performance. And I think there&rsquo;s merit to that. But I hadn&rsquo;t considered much that there&rsquo;s another format that can achieve similar outcomes. In the language of <a href="https://twitter.com/blairenns">Blair Enns</a>&rsquo; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2N0eiyi">Win Without Pitching Manifesto</a></cite>, I could &ldquo;replace presentations with conversations.&rdquo; I do that almost completely in client work but not for conferences.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect this, but I&rsquo;m now seriously considering this format as a way I do talks at other conferences. (I&rsquo;d love feedback about that from other conference organizers, if you have opinions.)</p>

<p>All this is to say: thanks to Vitaly and the Smashing Magazine and Smashing Conference crew for challenging the typical format. I learned a lot about how I can be a better speaker.</p>

<p>Do we have too many design systems?</p>

<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m biased: most of <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>&rsquo;s work nowadays involves either creating a design system or modifying one as part of a larger effort for a client. But why even go through any of that effort in the first place?</p>

<p>When I started <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/researching-design-systems/">researching design systems</a> for <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html">Unity</a>, the design system we made for ExxonMobil, my biggest observation was that the digital design systems out at the time were extremely generic. There&rsquo;s a lot of benefit to that: part of the job of a design system is to <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">take care of the boring stuff</a> to free you up to tackle the more exciting and challenging bits, so some amount of convention is expected and encouraged. That genericness is what allows designers and developers to create quickly, not to overthink our interfaces and unnecessarily reinvent the wheel. It&rsquo;s no surprise that <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is as popular as it is: you can build something significant with even a basic understanding of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> without a lot of fuss. And <a href="https://www.uplabs.com/search?q=material">a quick search on UpLabs</a> shows how much can be done with Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, we need better tools. In fact, a lot of our design system work has used &ldquo;better than Bootstrap&rdquo; or &ldquo;more meaningful than Material&rdquo; as a creative brief or rallying cry of sorts. But what does it mean to be better? Every client I work with has at least one problem or challenge that Bootstrap or Material Design didn&rsquo;t anticipate. That&rsquo;s not to disparage those tools; it was never their job to do in the first place. This is where a distinct design system can be helpful: to solve your organization&rsquo;s unique problems in a way a generic tool isn&rsquo;t designed to help with.</p>

<h2>Relying on Principles</h2>

<p>Web developer and author <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> shares <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/13844">some great wisdom</a> about design systems:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not very useful to create a library of patterns without providing any framework for using those patterns.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Often times, that framework comes in the form of principles, which is likely why most design systems have them. Design Principles <abbr>FTW</abbr> <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/what-are-design-principles">describes two types of principles</a>: universal and specific. The problem is that most design systems stop at universal principles. For example, <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/design-principles/">SAP Fiori&rsquo;s design principles</a> are all universal. While &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; and &ldquo;simple&rdquo; apply to Fiori, they also apply to, well, every other design system too. I&rsquo;m not implying malice or ignorance here; I think that&rsquo;s a result of 1) the difficulty of writing great, specific principles and 2) the fact that having only universal principles are better than having nothing at all.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/2004/12/the_pvrblog_int.html">TiVo has specific design principles</a> like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s entertainment, stupid.</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s <abbr>TV</abbr>, stupid.</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s video, dammit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very brand! Such tone! Those wouldn&rsquo;t work for a car manufacturer or a tech company. Specific design principles should fit your organization perfectly and look awkward on everyone else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see every design system strive for an <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/onlyness/">only-ness</a>, some unique angle or aspect that other design systems don&rsquo;t cater to. Your product or organization probably has a specific perspective on the problem it&rsquo;s trying to solve in the world; your design system should reflect, refract, and reverberate that position. (If your organization <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have that differentiation, you&rsquo;ve got some foundational identity work to do.)</p>

<p>That only-ness doesn&rsquo;t have only to be principle-driven; it could come directly from the mission of your company. In Vox Media senior design director <a href="https://twitter.com/yeseniaa">Yesenia Perez-Cruz</a>&rsquo;s talk, <cite><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/yeseniaperezcruz/building-flexible-design-systems?slide=17">Building Flexible Design Systems</a></cite>, she nails what Vox&rsquo;s design system is built for: telling better stories, faster. That clear purpose drives what components they need, what scenarios to design for, and what they can work toward together.</p>

<h2>Reverse-engineering principles from components</h2>

<p>One workflow tip I&rsquo;ve tried to put to good use is that you don&rsquo;t have to define principles before you create components; it&rsquo;s not a one-way street. Many times, you can derive your principles from how the work gets done. Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/markboulton">Mark Boulton</a> shares <a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/defining-design-principles-at-embl">his experience with this flexibility around design principles</a>:</p>          

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a team can quickly pull together principles that are derived from doing the work on their particular problem rather than principles which are imposed on the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A team can do this because the general public can too. Here&rsquo;s a quick inventory of a handful of design systems and the components they contain:</p>

<p>By looking across components in aggregate, we can very clearly see what the boring stuff is, because most of these design systems have them. That&rsquo;s stuff like buttons and form elements, as just about all of these design systems seem to contain them.</p>

<p>More interesting, however, are the components that only appear in one of these design systems. (Ignore the ones that look isolated but are actually just a result of non-standard taxonomies for components.) They start to give you a clue as to the unique value proposition of each design system. For example, FutureLearn&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/pattern-library/molecules/quiz-progress-nav">Quiz Progress Nav</a> only seems appropriate in environments where one is being tested online, which already starts to give you a clue as to what FutureLearn does. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtwax">Emmet Connolly</a>, director of product design for <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, calls this <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/the-full-stack-design-system/">a full stack design system</a>. He suggests building everything around the core objects of your brand or organization. Here are some examples of what that might be for some well-known companies:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Friend, Post, Message, Event, Page, Group.</li>
	<li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> Listing, Host, Guest, Trip, Experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Slack:</strong> Team, Member, Channel, Message, Reaction, Thread.</li>
	<li><strong>Intercom:</strong> Customer, Teammate, Message, Conversation, Article.</li>
</ul>

<p>By focusing on this kind of specificity, I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more innovative and interesting design systems pop up in the near future. I sure hope so!</p>

<p>Creating an Only-ness Statement is one of my favorite exercises to do with new clients. I first came across it in my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jpostendorf">J&auml;n Paul Ostendorf</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2NAUGB6">Brand Formation Workbook</a>, who found it in <a href="http://www.martyneumeier.com/">Marty Neumeier</a>&rsquo;s book <a href="https://amzn.to/2HGJIej">Zag</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple premise: every brand on the planet should be able to say what it&rsquo;s the only one of. Marty suggests this simple format:</p>

<p>
    What:<br />
    How:<br />
    Who:<br />
    Where:<br />
    Why:<br />
    When:<br />
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Harley-Davidson is:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>What</td>

<p>A great test of the only-ness statement is to put a competitor&rsquo;s name in place and see if it still fits. Slotting in Triumph Motorcycles or Suzuki or Yamaha makes this statement awkward at best and inaccurate at worst; therefore, it&rsquo;s a worthy statement for Harley-Davidson.</p>

<p>Jan suggests a slightly different framing&mdash;a sort-of mad libs style&mdash;which I find a little easier to use:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the only <input type="text" placeholder="Type of digital experience" /> that <input type="text" placeholder="Unique service or product you provide" /> for <input type="text" placeholder="Target audience" /> in <input type="text" placeholder="Geographic region or market segment" /> who want to <input type="text" placeholder="Customer&rsquo;s emotional motivation" /> during a time of <input type="text" placeholder="Increasing or decreasing cultural trend" />.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll often use this exercise in workshops with large groups. The format is similar to a <a href="http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/design-studioprototyping-exercise/">design studio</a> setup. I&rsquo;ll start by giving each person 2 worksheets to fill out over 8 minutes. Once the 8 minutes are up, I&rsquo;ll pair people together and ask them to create one worksheet between the two of them. That could mean using whichever one version is best, or maybe the pair creates a brand new one with the best of each of their ideas. Groups of two get combined into groups of four people, then eight&hellip; you get the idea. The ultimate output is two or three versions that conceivably reflect the best or most rallying ideas in the room. For example, <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/about-verywell-thebalance.html">when we worked with Dotdash</a> to create new home and lifestyle site <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/">The Spruce</a>, here were the three final only-ness statements that we used to drive our <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/on-creative-direction/">creative direction</a> for the whole project:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>home and food website</strong> that <strong>simplifies and empowers DIYers and aspiring superheroes</strong> who want to <strong>conquer their to-do list and feel proud</strong> during a time of <strong>perceived and unachievable perfection</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>immersive home life site</strong> that <strong>gives you what you came for and more</strong> for <strong>people like you</strong> who want to <strong>feel good about what you come home</strong> to during a time of <strong>increasing choice and decreasing bandwidth</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>lifestyle brand</strong> that <strong>gives practical, real-world advice and ideas</strong> for <strong>the roll-up-your-sleeves crowd and those looking for inspiration</strong> who want to <strong>reinvigorate their home life with small victories</strong> during a time when <strong>food and home trends feel unattainable.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>You can simultaneously see different themes emerging in each, but there are also more than a few common threads among them too. This type of clarity and insight can lead to unique strategy for any brand.</p>

<p>Next time you start work with a new client&mdash;or heck, maybe you use your own business or employer as a test&mdash;feel free to give this a shot to see if it gives you a new perspective. Good luck!</p>

<p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">After four days</span> of working together, she finally admitted, &ldquo;No one ever taught me how to scope.&rdquo; I was working with one of my clients&rsquo; senior developers to map out exactly how we were going to get all of the work done that we needed, but a few frustrating hours of going in circles finally revealed the culprit. It&rsquo;s a problem I&rsquo;ve seen from very junior to some of the most senior employees I&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>

<p>Simply put, I like to define <dfn>scope</dfn> as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A description of all the work that needs to get done, and</li>
    <li>The time needed to do said work.</li> 
</ol>

<p>That can be as simple as building a website in 5 days or as complex as organizing an entire ad campaign. Regardless, the formula remains intact.</p>

<p>Good scoping is often a case of simple arithmetic; by the time you were 8 or 9 years old, you&rsquo;ve had the skills to scope well. So why is it so difficult? You&rsquo;re mostly fighting the psychology of it all.</p>

<p>If I asked you if you could build a website (of any given complexity) in 6 months, I&rsquo;d bet your answer would be, &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect">valence effect</a> at play: your tendency to think that more good will happen to you than bad. Throw a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&rsquo;s law</a> in there (the adage that work expands to fill the time available for its completion) and that explains why you&rsquo;ve taken way longer on every project than you should have&mdash;and felt good about it to boot. The reality is closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter&rsquo;s law</a>: it always takes longer than you expect (even when you take into account Hofstadter&rsquo;s law). Rather than relying on gut feelings, we can use math to figure out if you&rsquo;ll meet your deadlines.</p>

<h2>Budgeting time</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people (and like me), it&rsquo;s difficult to save money. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to save $6,000 for a vacation next year. That&rsquo;s a daunting task at first glance, but it becomes easier when you break it down. Instead of looking at it as $6k, look at it as $500/month ($6,000 &divide; 12 months). Or maybe it&rsquo;s $125/week ($500 &divide; 4 weeks). Or $25/day ($125 &divide; 5 days). When you look at it that way, for every day you go to work, skip your Starbucks coffee, pack a lunch, throw that $25 in a jar, and watch that vacation happen in no time. By breaking it down into digestible chunks, it&rsquo;s much more manageable!</p>

<p>If it helps, think of scoping like a budget for your time.</p>

<h2>Building a website in 5 days</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the simple example from earlier: building a website in 5 days. If it&rsquo;s a 5-page website, our basic math skills (5 pages &divide; 5 days) tell us that we need to average building about 1 page per day. So far, our workload would look like this:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col">Workload</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Monday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Tuesday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Wednesday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Thursday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Friday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>But we can break that down even further, because building a page has three components to it: <abbr title="HyperText Marktup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript. So, let&rsquo;s divide a typical 9am&ndash;5pm workday into four parts (because lunch is incredibly important too, kids):</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Monday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Tuesday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Wednesday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Thursday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Friday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is much better! The specificity here can help to assess if this is a realistic plan. But we can break it down even further.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say the first page has 4 different sections. We can average the time to write the markup for each section, for example:</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="9" scope="row" >Monday</th>
            <td colspan="3" >Page 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4" >HTML</td>
            <td >Section 1</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;9:30am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Section 2</td>
            <td >9:30am&ndash;10:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Section 3</td>
            <td >10:00am&ndash;10:30am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Section 4</td>
            <td >10:30am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2" >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2" >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2" >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can continue to break down each task further if it&rsquo;s useful to do so, but, even at this level, you can realistically assess the work. Can you write a section of <abbr>HTML</abbr> in 30 minutes? If yes, great! You&rsquo;re on schedule and will make your timeline. If not, what can you adjust or reorder to make it work?</p>

<p>Herein lies the real beauty of this technique: <strong>you&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;re in danger of missing a deadline days, weeks, or even months in advance.</strong> For example, if you haven&rsquo;t completed Section 3 of Page 1&rsquo;s <abbr>HTML</abbr> by Monday at 10:30am, you&rsquo;re going to miss your deadline. Sure, it&rsquo;s possible that you may make up the time later on, but if you&rsquo;ve estimated realistically and remember Hofstadter&rsquo;s law, now&mdash;4 days in advance&mdash;is a good time to ask your client or manager for an extra day, just in case.</p>

<p>Scoping is about appropriately setting expectations for yourself, your team, and your clients and managers. It&rsquo;s a rare skill that separates the amateurs from the professionals. Which one are you?</p>

<p>I have a framework that I find very helpful in teaching <a href="http://superfriend.ly/academy/">my apprentices</a> how to design. It&rsquo;s 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="#imitate">Imitate</a></li>
    <li><a href="#remix">Remix</a></li>
    <li><a href="#invent">Invent</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the details.</p>

<h2>1. Imitate</h2>

<p>The first step to being just a competent designer—or a competent anything, for that matter—is doing what someone else can do. It&rsquo;s a test: can you follow directions? Except, instead of following directions you read or hear, you follow directions that you see. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that junior designers often get trained up by doing production work after an art director has set an art direction. If the art director makes the main headline 48px bold Helvetica with 16px of margin on each side, do you do the same on every screen you design? Sounds simple, but many junior designers struggle to even get this down. Why? Many want to be chefs but aren&rsquo;t willing to be line cooks first. It&rsquo;s not glamorous work, but it builds design muscles, muscles that you&rsquo;ll need in order to get better and advance to the next step. </p>

<p>Think of it like learning to draw by tracing. In fact, it’s literally the same thing. The first few assignments of my designers&rsquo; apprenticeships are taking screenshots of existing websites, pasting them into Sketch or Photoshop, dropping the opacity and locking the layer, and tracing over it to produce the same layout, colors, illustrations, typography, and everything else needed to reproduce the site pixel for pixel.</p>

<p>In his article <cite><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/improving-ui-design-skills-copywork/">Copy If You Can: Improving Your UI Design Skills With Copywork</a></cite>, Erik Kennedy extols the virtues of copywork as a great way to practice and hone <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> design skills. Even more, it gets you out of going to your usual bag of tricks and instead gives you new ones to add.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Done right, copywork exposes you to design decisions you simply wouldn&rsquo;t have made on your own.</p>
    <address>Erik Kennedy</address>
</blockquote> 


<p>Whether new to design or a seasoned creative director, this simple exercise will get you warmed up, like stretching before a long run.</p>

<h2>2. Remix</h2>

<p>Once you can confidently imitate any style you come across, you can start to tweak the elements to feel more custom to the way you need to use it. This step has the least parameters and needs the least guidelines, because it&rsquo;s up to your imagination and the amount of changes you&rsquo;re willing to try.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the idea that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%201:9">there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun</a>. Said differently, <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/">everything is a remix</a>. Freed from the pressure that all things designers do need to be original works of art, I can instead focus my efforts on what sources to combine in a unique way that my audience is less accustomed to.</p>

<h2>3: Invent</h2>

<p>Pablo Picasso is well known for his original Cubist work, but most people don&rsquo;t know that he was an excellent classical artist first. He could draw and paint photorealism as well as any of the great masters, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he got that down that he ventured into his own unknown stylistic territory.</p>

<p>In his Wall Street Journal article, <cite><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838">The Genius of the Tinkerer</a></cite>, author Steven Johnson describes a concept he calls <em>the adjacent possible</em>. He tells the story of a young orthopedic surgeon who, while diving in the Great Barrier Reef, observes a species of coral that seem to be able to heal itself as it breaks. Years later, while operating on a patient, he recalls this coral and its amazing bonding powers. Several years and patents later, his method is the leading way that orthopedic surgeons around the world help their patients mend their broken bones.</p>

<p>The adjacent possible is about taking two seemingly unconnected ideas and metaphorically placing them next to each other to see how they might work together. Clients often hire me to invent unique and original art directions for them. I can deliver on this by using the adjacent possible to steal my way to something original.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations.</p>
    <address>Steven Johnson</address>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how this works in practice. </p>

<p>Say SpaceZzzz&trade; hired me to create a site to advertise a new service they&rsquo;re offering: rental properties on different planets. They&rsquo;d get you there, you stay as long as you&rsquo;d like, and they&rsquo;ll get you back. Think <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> meets <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> meets <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a>. </p>

<p>The first thing I&rsquo;ll do is make a list of all of the types of content I&rsquo;ll need on the homepage. After talking to stakeholders and potential users in the target market, perhaps I&rsquo;d arrive at 5 different sections:</p>

<ol>
    <li>An elevator pitch about the new service </li>
    <li>A featured destination (or a few features)</li>
    <li>Some details about what people may be anxious about, like long travel or planetary accommodations </li>
    <li>Price </li>
    <li>Contact details </li>
</ol>

<p>To start, I&rsquo;ll block out these main sections with a few <a href="http://v3.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2004/05/24/grey_box_method.php">gray boxes</a>.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/gray-boxes.png" alt="Gray boxes for page sections" />

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll start to choose a few reference sources to imitate. This is key:  be sure to choose sources far away from what you&rsquo;re designing. If you&rsquo;re designing a bank site, don&rsquo;t choose another bank site as reference, especially within the same competitive set. Since we may be modeling this after Airbnb, using Airbnb as a reference is probably too close to feel original. One trick I often use is to start smaller. Rather than try to use a whole page as a reference, I&rsquo;ll pick a few different designs to source different elements from.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stub out each section by simply copying and pasting from my source material into my gray box document. (I&rsquo;m using Photoshop for this example because it&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m fastest, but you can use any design app you prefer.) This sets me up with something to imitate and remix.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/witness.jpg" alt="" />

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll trace over my stubbed-out version with simple shapes to get a feel for how it could work together. I&rsquo;ll also start to remix a bit by choosing some new colors. I own this Nike Witness shirt and thought these colors would work well for this subject matter.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/blocked-out.png" alt="Tracing over stubbed-out version" />

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll fill in some text content by tracing over the text of the original stubs, but trying to unify them by remixing them with the same typeface. I decide on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans">PT Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono">PT Mono</a> and use this stage to start working out some sizing of headlines and body copy to rough out my typographic hierarchy.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/filled-in.png" alt="Filling in text content" />

<p>Now that I have a good approximation of all my content, I&rsquo;ll start to draw a grid so I can organize that content appropriately. My approach to grids has always been to <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/a-richer-canvas">start with content</a> and use the least amount of columns possible. Looking at the Locations section, that&rsquo;s a pretty good candidate for 4 equal-width columns, so I&rsquo;ll start there.</p>

<p>However, as I look at the top hero and <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> areas, I realize that some of those headings need to start in the middle of a column, so I&rsquo;ll split the 4-column grid into 8 columns instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about using an <a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">8-point grid</a> <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">before</a>&mdash;which I&rsquo;m using increasingly more in my own work&mdash;so all my spacings and type sizes here are a multiple of 8.</p>

    <figcaption>An 8-column grid</figcaption>
</figure>        


<p>That 8-column grid is looking pretty good everywhere except for the Pricing table. That section contains 5 specific areas:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Basic</li>
    <li>Pro</li>
    <li>Teams</li>
    <li>Corporate</li>
</ol>

<p>5 sections over 8 columns doesn&rsquo;t divide evenly, so I&rsquo;ll need another split. By subdividing into 16 columns, that&rsquo;ll let me do a 4-column feature listing and 3 columns for each of the plans. 16 columns it is.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to start inserting more of my content into this shell, specifically my own copy and artwork. The key to stealing in a way that leads to something original is that your result needs to be unrecognizable from the source material as much as possible. Take the hero unit for example.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero1.png" alt="Hero unit" />

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to compare this to the original source and tell where it came from. Flipping the orientation of elements is a really useful way to to get around that. Let&rsquo;s move the main headline and the call to action to the opposite side of the screen.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero2-flip.png" alt="Hero unit flipped" />

<p>Let&rsquo;s add our own artwork.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero3-artwork.png" alt="Hero unit with artwork" />

<p>The artwork goes a long way into making this feel original, but there&rsquo;s still one more thing we need to do. That notched-out call to action is such a unique piece that it&rsquo;s become signature to the original source. It still feels like someone could identify the source from that element.</p>

<p>Instead of notching it out, let&rsquo;s do a colorblocked overlap call-to-action. Once I do that, I realize the opportunity to mirror that visual language on the top left with the logo. Given that the original source is so flat, I&rsquo;ll add a subtle drop shadow to give those elements some depth.</p>

<p>You can see that, with just a few moves, I&rsquo;ve moved this away from an interface I&rsquo;ve stolen to something that feels way more original.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero4-overlap.png" alt="Hero unit with overlapped button and logo" />

<p>If I take that approach to each element of this page&mdash;just a few moves each to distinguish it from its original source&mdash;I can easily go from a design I&rsquo;ve stolen to an original version I&rsquo;ve invented on my own.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/invent.png" alt="Invented comp" />

<p>And lastly, a side-by-side comparison for effect.</p>

<p>I hope this was a useful primer in showing you how to steal you way to an original design. In the words of English philosopher <abbr>C.E.M.</abbr> Joad, &ldquo;Creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&rdquo; The more obscure your references, the more sources you combine, the more moves away from the original you can take, the more original your design will become.</p>

<p>For those that want to dissect the final source file in more detail, you can <a href="spaceZzzz.psd.zip">download the <abbr title="Photoshop Document">PSD</abbr> (51.2MB) here</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck with your stealing!</p>

<p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">Pilots are one of</span> the best ways to put your design system through its paces, especially before the design system even gets to a <var>v1</var>. Like television pilots help test audience reactions to a series concept without investing significant resources to create the whole thing, application pilots are a good foundation for ensuring your design system&rsquo;s design and code are battle-tested.</p> 

<p>Here is how my teams and I identify great pilot candidates.</p> 

<p>First, we want to know what kinds of digital products a design system should help our client to make. We&rsquo;ll ask them to tee up as many product presentations as they can muster. They&rsquo;ll usually do this by either generating a list of product owners that tend to be early adopters/risk takers, or they&rsquo;ll issue an open call for willing participants.</p>

<p>We review anywhere from dozens to hundreds of existing products to get a good lay of the land for what the organization makes regularly and supports. This might be walking through products in person or on a screenshare with a product owner, asking questions and exploring as many of the hidden crevasses as possible. It also could be clicking through public or private apps ourselves, inventorying what&rsquo;s common.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;ll also do an <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/">interface inventory</a>, taking note of the frequency of usage of common components.</p> 

<p>We&rsquo;ll then try and reverse-engineer where our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> comes into play: what 20% can we design and build that can assuage 80% of the wheel reinvention pain?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a sweet spot for great pilot candidates after planning for the pilot has begun but before it gets designed or built. If a product isn&rsquo;t far enough along in planning, we likely don&rsquo;t know enough about it to say whether it&rsquo;ll make for a good pilot or not. But if it&rsquo;s already in the process of being created or recreated, it&rsquo;s probably too far along to be able to integrate parts&mdash;read: component design, patterns, and/or working code&mdash;from the design system without some amount of refactor, which teams in need of a design system often can&rsquo;t afford.</p>

<p>Once we find a some good potential candidates in that sweet spot, there&rsquo;s a set of criteria we use to determine a pilot&rsquo;s potential efficacy:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Potential for common components.</strong> Does this pilot have many components that can be reused in other products?</li>
    <li><strong>Potential for common patterns.</strong> Does this pilot have many patterns that can be reused in other products?</li>
    <li><strong>High-value elements.</strong> Even if uncommon, is there a component or pattern with high-business value that is the heart of this project? We&rsquo;re talking elements that are integral to a flow or audience that has unusually high value for the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical feasibility.</strong> How simple is a technical implementation of the design system? Is a large refactor required?</li>
    <li><strong>Available champion.</strong> Will someone working on this product see it through and celebrate/evangelize using the design system (and even contributing back to it)?</li>
    <li><strong>Scope.</strong> Is this work accomplishable in our pilot timeframe of [3&ndash;4 weeks] (insert your timing here)?</li>
    <li><strong>Technical independence.</strong> Is the work decoupled enough from other legacy design and code that there are clear start and end points?</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing potential.</strong> Will this work excite others to use the design system?</li>
</ol>

<p>You might already see where we could go with this. Using a simple point system where <var>1</var> indicates a low match and <var>10</var> indicates high efficacy, you could create a Pilot Scorecard that shows you which products to tackle in priority order:</p>

<p>Starting with pilots before you have anything in your design system allows <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html#inventionhappensintheproducts">invention to happen in the products</a>. In the next pass of using your design system, you can <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">cook with your new ingredients</a> to make sure you have the right pieces in place.</p>

<p>Have you used pilots in your design systems journeys? How have they helped you?</p>

<ol>
    <li>I&rsquo;m talking specifically about products that are being built from scratch or reimagined. However, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that you may have a product already built that&rsquo;s clearly a good foundation for a design system. If that&rsquo;s the case, no need to pilot; instead, extract and abstract the appropriate components and patterns you need. Mobile designer <a href="https://twitter.com/bigmediumjosh">Josh Clark</a> describes this in more detail in his article, &ldquo;<a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">The Most Exciting Design Systems are Boring</a>.&rdquo; <a href="#fn1-source">&#8617;</a></li>
    <li>In his article, &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/patterns-components-2ce778cbe4e8">Patterns &#8800; Components</a>,&rdquo; systems designer <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis">Nathan Curtis</a> describes the difference between a pattern and a component, which is why they&rsquo;re separate items in this article. <a href="#fn2-source">&#8617;</a></li>

<p>My father-in-law (a retired pastor) shared with me a simple framework he crafted from many years of preaching sermons week after week. Every good story has these three components:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Bad news.</li>
    <li>Good news. </li>
    <li>So what?</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know how to tell a good story, but that&rsquo;s easily solved with this simple trick. You&rsquo;ll soon have your listeners hanging on your every word!</p>

<p>(See how I just used that framework? 😉 )</p>

<p>A great design system should equip you to quickly and confidently create delicious user experiences. Creating a great design system is a lot like stocking a very specific kind of kitchen.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I run a food truck. I have a small kitchen in said truck, so I need to be judicious in what ingredients I stock. To determine the right ingredients to bring along, I can ask myself a few simple questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What dishes will I <em>definitely</em> make? What ingredients do I need to make those dishes?</li>
    <li>What dishes <em>might</em> I make? What ingredients do I need to make those dishes?</li>
</ol>

<p>What&rsquo;s on my menu? If I run a Mexican street food truck, I&rsquo;ll have main dishes like tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. I&rsquo;ll have a few appetizers and sides like street corn, empanadas, and chips &amp; salsa. But, I&rsquo;ll also need the ingredients that make those mains and sides, even if they&rsquo;re not specifically listed on my menu&mdash;lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, paprika, avocado, rice, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, tortillas, tomatilos, oregano, cilantro, cheese, etc. These are all the things I&rsquo;ll need to bring with me onto the truck.</p>

<p>Part of what&rsquo;s important in what I&rsquo;m bringing is also what I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> bringing. Dill and cinnamon are great spices in general, but I don&rsquo;t plan on making anything with them, so I can leave out for now. (And I can always change my mind later.)</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve been running my food truck for a while, I know that some dishes will almost always get ordered, so I can prep them in advance. I can start cooking rice. I can chop lettuce and cabbage. I can set up my <a class="dm-u-fontStyle--italic" lang="fr" href="https://vimeo.com/177133790#t=1h16m28s" title="&ldquo;Build Right: Maker Series on Design Workflow with Dan Mall&rdquo; on Vimeo">mise en place</a> so that it&rsquo;s ready for use when customers start ordering.</p>

<p>I can get some headstarts too. I can throw a cup of salsa and a handful of chips into a bag and seal it; no more assembly required. I can also pre-cook beef with onions, spices, and marinade to be ready to throw into a taco or burrito. This one needs to be finished with a tortilla and some veggies, but I don&rsquo;t need to start from scratch everytime someone orders a beef dish.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s helpful for me to think about these things in categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Raw ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>&hellip;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Headstarts</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Chips &amp; Salsa</li>
            <li>Beef &amp; Onions</li>
            <li>&hellip;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dishes</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Mains</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tacos
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chicken</li>
                            <li>Beef</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Burritos
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chicken</li>
                            <li>Beef</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>&hellip;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>                        
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Sides</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Street Corn</li>
                    <li>Empanadas</li>
                    <li>&hellip;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>                        
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out this is also a pretty good model for organizing a design system.</p>

<p>Even though many have been using these phrases for years, you can tell it&rsquo;s still early days regarding things like &ldquo;design systems,&rdquo; &ldquo;component libraries,&rdquo; and &ldquo;style guides&rdquo; because we can&rsquo;t yet get the words right. Everyone insists that they&rsquo;re different, but we still use them interchangeably. <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/researching-design-systems/">Canonical definitions for each have yet to emerge</a>. Until they do, I&rsquo;ll use the ones that best fit for and most appeal to me.</p>

<p>Graphics editors like Photoshop and Sketch allow you&mdash;but also force you&mdash;to create everything from scratch. A strict component library might encourage you to only use the components as they come without any customization; a good example was <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/cn/devnet/flash/articles/skinning_flash_cs3/_jcr_content/articlecontentAdobe/image.img.jpg/1276162998293.jpg">Flash&rsquo;s component library</a> (Bueller?). Design systems fit somewhere in between. A design system is the smallest set of tools to help me effectively create what I need.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that graphics editors and component libraries aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. Most examples in the wild aren&rsquo;t purely one or the other, or at least easily convert closer to the certain. <a href="https://www.sketchappsources.com/tag/kit.html">Add a UI Kit to Sketch</a> and it gets closer to a design system. Add some spacing and sizing tokens to a component library and it gets closer to a design system.</p>

<p>Testing a design system&rsquo;s efficacy is easy on paper: can you easily create what you intend to? Back to our metaphor, can I quickly make a delicious burrito? Like a well-stocked but limited kitchen, a good design system is a combination of raw ingredients and headstarts to make delicious dishes. It&rsquo;s as many of these things as you need, and no more.</p>

<p>I wanted to create and maintain this site primarily with a design system&mdash;not a graphics editor or a component library&mdash;so I brought along a limited pantry:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Raw ingredients (utilities and mixins)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Text sizes</li>

            <li>&hellip;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Headstarts</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Headings</li>

            <li>List patterns</li>
            <li>Content boxes</li>                        
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dishes</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Mains</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Landing Templates
                        <ul>

            </li>                        
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>

                </ul>
            </li>                        
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>How did I decide what&rsquo;s what? I&rsquo;m glad you asked.</p>

<p>Prolific designer <a href="https://www.miltonglaser.com/">Milton Glaser</a> <a href="http://brendandawes.com/blog/Glaser">said</a>, &ldquo;I move things around until they look right,&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s most of what I do in Photoshop and Sketch, I need a way to do that in code.</p>

<p>First, I need to make the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that need to be moved around. That means writing the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> I need as <a href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/" title="&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk about Semantics,&rdquo; on HTML5Doctor">semantically</a> as possible.</p>

<p>Then, I started to build some &ldquo;move around&rdquo; tools. I&rsquo;m a big fan of how <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a> <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/" title="&ldquo;BEMIT: Taking the BEM Naming Convention a Step Further,&rdquo; by Harry Roberts">suggests organizing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a> for maximum maintainability, and I just wrapped a project with <a href="http://twitter.com/brad_frost">Brad Frost</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/frostyweather">Ian Frost</a> where we used with a similar <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/"><abbr>CSS</abbr> architecture</a>. I also wanted to try out the <a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">8-point grid</a> that all the kids are raving about.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/variables.scss">some variables</a> so that I can change spacing globally if the 8-pt thing doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<pre><code>
$spacing            :       8;

$xs                 :       $spacing;
$s                  :       $spacing * 2;
$m                  :       $spacing * 3;
$l                  :       $spacing * 4;
$xl                 :       $spacing * 5;
$xxl                :       $spacing * 6;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, some spacing mixins:</p>

<pre><code>
@mixin dm-u-margin--0 {
margin: 0;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xs {
margin: $xs + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--s {
margin: $s + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--m {
margin: $m + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--l {
margin: $l + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xl {
margin: $xl + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xxl {
margin: $xxl + px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes about that:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>dm-</code> is my namespace for the site. (Stands for &ldquo;Dan Mall.&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><code>u-</code> stands for &ldquo;utility.&rdquo; More on this later.</li>
    <li>I made <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/mixins.scss">a lot of individual mixins</a> for margins (top, right, bottom, left) and padding. Seems like overkill, but comes in really handy.</li>      
</ul>

<p>I also duplicated those mixins in a <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/utilities.scss"><code>utilities.scss</code></a> file so that I could use them in both <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-u-margin--0 {
@include dm-u-margin--0;
}

.dm-u-margin--xs {
@include dm-u-margin--xs;
}

.dm-u-margin--s {
@include dm-u-margin--s;
}

.dm-u-margin--m {
@include dm-u-margin--m;
}

.dm-u-margin--l {
@include dm-u-margin--l;
}

.dm-u-margin--xl {
@include dm-u-margin--xl;
}

.dm-u-margin--xxl {
@include dm-u-margin--xxl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as <abbr title="Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> as I&rsquo;d like it to be, but I&rsquo;m happy to trade principle for the pragmatism of moving quickly in code.</p>

<p>Once I feel like I have a thorough enough set of raw ingredients, <em>my goal is to create as much of the site as I can without opening my stylesheet again</em>. If I can do this, I&rsquo;m <em>using</em> my design system, as opposed to creating patterns on the fly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do an example: a basic article page. I&rsquo;ll start by creating the title of the page:</p>


<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to style this headline to be somewhat large, have a little space on the left, and have some room below. Without a design system, I might create a new <code>class</code> and write some new styles, but remember: I want to use my design system and not add anything new to my stylesheet. So, I&rsquo;ll use some rules that I&rsquo;ve already created:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 class="dm-u-text--xl dm-u-paddingLeft--m dm-u-marginBottom--l"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>    

<p>This style of coding certainly isn&rsquo;t new; many framework like <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>, <a href="https://acss.io/">Atomic <abbr>CSS</abbr></a>, or <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/expressive-css/">Expressive <abbr>CSS</abbr></a> have suggested this for a long time. The biggest criticism of this approach is that it isn&rsquo;t much better than writing inline styles, and you lose a lot of the benefits of the cascade that made <abbr>CSS</abbr> so powerful in the first place. True, at first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t look much different than:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 style="font-size: 40px; padding-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 32px;"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>              

<p>But I&rsquo;d argue that there are still a few benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Visual consistency.</strong> If you&rsquo;re using class names instead of inline styles and are using something like the 8-pt grid, you know you won&rsquo;t ever have a situation where one headline has 16px of padding and another has 17px. You&rsquo;re using your design system!</li>
    <li><strong>A limited pantry.</strong> The beauty and the curse that comes with a graphics editor is that the world is your oyster. Want to nudge that particular piece of text over half a pixel? Go for it. Make your developers go crazy and set your <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr> users ablaze. Using your already established conventions through class names gives you a beneficial constraint. Part of Sketch&rsquo;s fast adoption with designers is no-doubt due to the fact that it&rsquo;s limited toolbar is a welcome constraint from the hundreds of tools at your fingertips in Photoshop. Take that same restrained approach to <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/dan-mall/2012-september-12">deciding in the browser</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get an even bigger benefit if you take this a step further. Let&rsquo;s say you create 3 more of these headlines. Congrats! You&rsquo;re on your way to a bona fide pattern! This is where I&rsquo;d crack back open my stylesheet, not to write more styles but to codify the pattern.</p>

<p>First question: is it a <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">content pattern or a display pattern</a>? It&rsquo;s a bit too specific to apply to a particular type of content; calling this a <code>articleTitle</code> may make me think twice about using this on the Contact page. Display pattern it is! We&rsquo;ll call this our <code>bigTitle</code>. I&rsquo;ll use a <code>dp-</code> prefix to mark it as such. So, the <abbr>HTML</abbr> turns into:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 class="dm-dp-bigTitle"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my stylesheet, I&rsquo;ll create a new rule for my new display pattern, but instead of writing custom declarations, I&rsquo;ll instead use my existing mixins, cut-and-pasted directly from my markup. Again, I want to <em>use what&rsquo;s already in my design system</em>, keeping things as <abbr>DRY</abbr> as I can. That rule would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-dp-bigTitle {
@include dm-u-text--xl;
@include dm-u-paddingLeft--m;
@include dm-u-marginBottom--l;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That way, I&rsquo;ll almost always know at a glance as I skim my stylesheet what parts use the design system I&rsquo;ve established and what parts deviate.</p>

<p>Last thing: I like to leave some space at the bottom of every rule for &ldquo;seasoning.&rdquo; In cooking, there&rsquo;s this phrase called &ldquo;season to taste,&rdquo; which means that you can continue to add spices and herbs if a dish doesn&rsquo;t taste perfect when it&rsquo;s done cooking. It might not be part of the recipe, but you need it in this specific instance. In the case of code, that might be applying a background color to an element or adding a particular animation:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-dp-bigTitle {
@include dm-u-text--xl;
@include dm-u-paddingLeft--m;
@include dm-u-marginBottom--l;

// seasoning
background-color: gold;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you can quickly visually identify what parts of this block are part of the design system, and which is some extra seasoning. After noticing that you&rsquo;re writing <code>background-color: gold;</code> 4 or 5 different times, then you can consider adding it permanently to your design system as a utility and/or mixin.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this example showed how you can bring some of the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> decision-making process you previously did in a graphics editor into the browser, as long as you have the right code approach to support it.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re cooking!</p>
